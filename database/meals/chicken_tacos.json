    "Season chicken breasts with the salt and pepper",
    "In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Cook the chicken until golden, about 3 minutes per side. Add the onion and cook, stirring, until slightly translucent, about 2 minutes. Stir in the tomatoes with their juices, lime juice, garlic, chili powder, vinegar, cumin, oregano, and sugar. Reduce the heat and simmer, uncovered, stirring frequently, until the chicken is cooked through, about 15 minutes.",
    "Transfer the chicken to a cutting board. Use two forks to shred the meat, then transfer it back to the skillet. To allow the taco sauce to really seep into the shredded chicken, simmer for 5 to 8 minutes more.",
    "If you’re using soft shells, warm the tortillas, sandwiched between damp paper towels, for about 30 seconds in the microwave. If you’re using hard shells, put them in a 250°F oven until warm, about 5 minutes"
