  "ingredients": [
    "Meat: Ground Beef, Ground Chuck (80/20), or Ground Beef Short Ribs",
    "Cast Iron Pan or Grill",
    "For the pan, use Beef Fat or cook Bacon first (don't use butter)",
    "Kaiser Roll / Potato Roll, plain toasted",
    "Lettuce/Tomato/Ketchup/Dill Pickles"
  ],
  "notes": [
    "Volcano Shape: dimple an outer-circle so that the middle and outer edge are highest (this shape is best to allow the burger to expand while cooking)",
    "Cast Iron Pan: a pan with sides are better than a flat skillet for convective heat",
    "Season with salt right-before cooking to help dry out the burger and form the crust (keeps the juice inside)",
    "Munster cheese (melts like American, but has flavor)"
  ],
  "rating": 2,
  "recipe": [
    "See notes section. Brief instructions below",
    "Work the meat into a patty until it sticks to your hand and won't fall off. Work to the diameter of the bun, but to a thickness of your thumb. Form into a volcano shape",
    "Season with salt. Set on pan and cook until browned. Add onion on top and flip. Cook until firm (medium-well). Add a slice of Munster and let partially melt. The cheese will continue to melt when removed"
