    "For the quinoa: Combine the quinoa, salt and water in a small saucepan over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat so that the water bubbles gently. Cover and cook for 13 to 15 minutes until all the water is absorbed and the quinoa is fluffy. Turn off the heat and let stand covered for 5 minutes. Uncover and fluff with a fork, then stir in the lime juice",
    "Meanwhile, start the burritos: Heat the oil until shimmering in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the red and green bell peppers, scallions and mushrooms. Cook for 3 to 5 minutes, until tender and slightly blackened, stirring occasionally. Add the pinto beans and their liquid, the adobo, cumin, garlic powder and salt. Cook for 2 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the liquid thickens. Taste, and if you’d like a little more heat, add a touch more adobo",
    "Now that the filling is done, warm the tortillas (don’t skip this step, because you’ll need the tortilla to be pliable enough to roll). Place a tortilla on the grate above a stove-top burner (or in a dry skillet), then cook on medium heat for a few seconds per side, flipping with tongs, until warmed through and pliable. If you are using a gas burner, the tortilla edges will char a bit. Repeat for the second tortilla",
    "Place the tortillas on individual plates. Spread half of the limey quinoa on each one, at the center. Top each with about half of the bean mixture (you may have a little more than you need, depending on the size of your tortillas), and half the sour cream and spinach or other greens. Fold the tortillas in half over the filling, then tuck them around and underneath the filling, forming a tight roll. Fold in each side of the burritos, then roll them up. Cut in half and serve"
