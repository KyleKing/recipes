    "Let the dough rest at room temperature for 20 minutes",
    "Put the cold pizza stone in a cold oven then preheat to 425",
    "Stretch out the dough, working initially flat, then pull and spin the dough until at least 12 inches in diameter",
    "Put a thin layer of flour on the pizza peel. Work quickly to prevent the dough from absorbing the flour and sticking. Additionally, regularly shake the peel to make sure the pizza slides around easily",
    "Add a thin layer of sauce (less than you think). Hold off on the rest of the toppings for now",
    "With a jittery back and forth motion, slide the pizza onto the stone",
    "Bake for 6-8 min, then remove from the oven with the pizza peel",
    "Add the cheese and other toppings and return to the pizza stone for another 5-10 min",
    "Finally remove and transfer to an over-sized cutting board to slice",
    "Wash the peel with soap and water. See the Tools/Pizza Stone section for stone care"
