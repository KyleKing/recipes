    "Let the dough rest at room temperature for 20 minutes",
    "Put the cold pizza stone in a cold oven then preheat to 425",
    "Place the dough on a lightly floured surface, then gently press it into a circle",
    "Once you have an 8-inch round, pick up the dough and gently drape it over the knuckles on both of your hands. Slowly rotate it, allowing gravity to stretch it into a round about 11 inches in diameter. If the dough starts to resist stretching, put it down and allow it to rest for a few minutes, at which point it should stretch more easily",
    "Put a thin layer of semolina (or flour) on the pizza peel. Quickly add the toppings to prevent the dough from absorbing the flour and sticking. Additionally, regularly shake the peel to make sure the pizza slides around easily",
    "Add a thin layer of sauce (less than you think). Hold off on the rest of the toppings for now",
    "With a jittery back and forth motion, slide the pizza onto the stone",
    "Bake for 6-8 min, then remove from the oven with the pizza peel",
    "Add the cheese and other toppings and return to the pizza stone for another 5-10 min",
    "Finally remove and transfer to a large cutting board to slice",
    "Wash the peel with soap and water. See the Tools/Pizza Stone section for stone care"
