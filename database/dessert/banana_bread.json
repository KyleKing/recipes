  "notes": [
    "Reader Tip: For a reduced-sugar version of this bread, cut the brown sugar in half (to 1/3 cup). Still retains moist texture and taste fine â€” simply less sweet, more banana-y",
    "Reader Tip: An easy way to mash bananas is to peel, cut into chunks, and place in a zip-top plastic bag, leaving about 1/4\" open at the top of the bag for air to escape. Gently knead/flatten/squash the banana chunks with your fingers",

    "WARN: We didn't make this with honey. See Joy of Cooking. Alt? https://tasty.co/recipe/one-bowl-chocolate-chip-banana-bread"

    "Preheat 325F. Lightly grease a 9\"x5\" loaf pan or a 12\"x4\" tea loaf pan",
    "In a large bowl, combine butter, sugar, vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg, baking soda, baking powder, and salt, beating till smooth",
    "Add the mashed bananas, jam, honey, and eggs. Again, beat until smooth",
    "Add the flour, then the walnuts, stirring just until smooth",
    "Spoon the batter into the prepared loaf pan, smoothing the top. Let it rest at room temperature for 10 minutes",
    "Bake the bread for 45 minutes, then gently lay a piece of aluminum foil across the top, to prevent over-browning",
    "Bake for an additional 25 minutes (20 minutes if you're baking in a tea loaf pan)",
    "Remove the bread from the oven; a long toothpick or cake tester inserted into the center should come out clean, with at most a few wet crumbs clinging to it. The tester shouldn't show any sign of uncooked batter. If it does, bake the bread an additional 5 minutes, or until it tests done",
    "Allow the bread to cool for 10 minutes in the pan",
    "Remove from pan and cool completely on a rack"
