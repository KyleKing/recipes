    "Beat the eggs together until homogeneous + pinch of salt",
    "Over medium-low heat, melt the butter in a skillet, then pour in the eggs.",
    "Using a rubber spatula, constantly scrape the bottom of the pan while shaking the pan in a circular motion to ensure that the eggs cook slowly, forming only small curds, about 1-2 minutes.",
    "Once you start to see the bottom of the pan for more than a second after scraping, push the eggs into a round circular shape. Cook until the edges solidify, then tilt the pan and carefully roll the omelette on itself.",
    "Invert onto a plate, then sprinkle with chives"
