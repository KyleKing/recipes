    "Preheat oven to 400ÂºF and line a baking sheet with parchment. Prep the lemon and place the zest and juice separately to the side",
    "In a large bowl, stir together the flour, salt, *1/4* cup powdered sugar, baking powder, poppy seeds, and 1 tsp lemon zest",
    "Stir the cream into the dry ingredients until a shaggy ball of dough forms. The dough will be fairly sticky. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface, divide it into three pieces, and shape each piece into a disc (about 3 inches diameter). Cut each disc into six triangles.",
    "Arrange the cut scones on the prepared baking sheet. Bake the scones for about 15 minutes, or until they just begin to barely turn golden brown on top.",
    "While the scones are baking, place the remaining 1/2 cup powdered sugar in a bowl. Stir in about 1 Tbsp lemon juice, or just enough to form a thick glaze.",
    "When the scones have baked, remove them from the oven, let them cool, then drizzle with the prepared lemon glaze."
