  "ingredients": [
    "3 to 4 oz fresh pineapple, plus a small slice or wedge for garnish",
    "1 1/2 oz light rum (may substitute a combination of light and gold rums)",
    "3/4 oz cream of coconut",

  "notes": [
    "Status: WIP",
    "The classic pina colada recipe results in a frothy, boozy, intensely sweet shake. This variation keeps the drink’s heart of pineapple and coconut but balances the sweetness with fresh lime juice",
    "You’ll need a blender",
    "Where to Buy: Cream of coconut is available at most grocery stores. Look for pineapple with a rich, sweet smell (or, if picking the pre-cut kind, look for fruit that’s intensely yellow)"

    "In the following order, combine these ingredients in a blender: the pineapple (to taste), rum, cream of coconut, lime juice and ice. Blend on the highest speed for 30 seconds, then pour into a highball glass",
    "Garnish with the pineapple slice or wedge and a sprinkling of lime zest. Serve right away"
