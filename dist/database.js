"Pierce sweet potatoes with a fork. (Originally: in a wet paper towel microwave on high for 12-13 minutes) Instead, try using the instant pot for 12 minutes at high pressure and low heat (TBD)",
"When cool, peel and mash in a medium bowl until smooth. Stir in ricotta and 1 tsp salt. Mix with a fork and scatter in flour until doughy mixture",
"Bring a gallon of water to boil over high heat",
"Lightly flour work surface and gently knead the dough 10 times folding 90 degrees each time.",
"Divide the dough into three equal pieces; gently roll each into a ball then into a log roughly 12 in x 1 in diameter. Cut the log crosswise/diagonally into 12 pieces (36 total)",
"Drop the gnocchi into the boiling water and stir for the first minute. Cook until they float to the surface (4-5 min)",
"In parallel, in a large skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. When the foam subsides add the sage and cook until the sage is crispy and the butter is browned (3 min)",
"Scoop the gnocchi out with a strainer and add to the skillet. Add the Parmesan and salt and pepper to taste."
