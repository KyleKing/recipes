"Meanwhile, add the pappardelle to the boiling water, and cook until al dente, 1 to 2 minutes less than the package directions. When the pasta is ready, use tongs to transfer it to the sauce, reserving the pasta water. Drizzle with olive oil, sprinkle with the parsley and toss to coat, adding a little reserved pasta water if the pan seems dry.",

"For the crust: Whisk together the flour, salt and yeast in a bowl or the bowl of your stand mixer. Stir to combine. Add the water and oil, stirring until a shaggy dough forms. Turn it out onto a floured surface",
"Knead the dough by pushing with the base of your palm, then re-forming it into a ball. Continue kneading for 8 minutes until the dough feels pillowy and has a smooth, stretchy exterior. If the dough is very sticky, add a small amount of flour while kneading",
"Alternatively, attach the dough hook to your stand mixer and start the mixer on medium-low speed, then allow the mixer to knead for 8 minutes",
"After the kneading is finished, divide the dough into 3 equal pieces. Use floured hands to gently shape each piece into a boule (ball shape) by folding the dough under itself. Set each boule on a floured surface and dab the dough with a bit of oil to keep it moist. Cover all boules with a damp towel and allow them to rise until doubled in size, about 45 minutes to 1 hour",
"The dough is ready to be used. However for the best flavor, transfer the dough to separate sealed containers, large enough for the dough to double in size again, and store in the refrigerator for 2 to 3 days",
"If you\u2019re using the dough after refrigerating: The day of serving, remove the dough from the containers, place it on a lightly floured surface covered with a towel and allow it to come to room temperature before stretching, 30 to 45 minutes",
"To stretch the dough, place it on a lightly floured surface and gently press it into a round, flipping several times and adding a pinch of flour if it is too sticky. Once it is about 8 inches in diameter, pick up the dough and gently drape it over the knuckles on both of your hands. Slowly rotate it around, allowing gravity to stretch it into a round about 11 inches in diameter. Do not overwork or fold the dough. If the dough starts to resist stretching, put it down and allow it to rest for a few minutes, at which point it will stretch more easily",
"When you're ready to bake your pizza, preheat the oven with a pizza stone in it to 500 degrees, or its highest number setting",
"For the sauce: This sauce takes just 2 minutes to make. Stir together the tomatoes, garlic powder, dried oregano, salt, oil and crushed red pepper flakes in a medium bowl. The yield is 1 cup; reserve half for another use",
"For the topping: Heat the oil in a small skillet until it\u2019s shimmering over medium-high heat. Add the broccoli and cook for 1 minute, then add 1/2 cup water and cover. Cook/steam for 3 to 4 minutes, until tender. Drain the water. Stir in the lemon juice and the 1/8 tsp of salt, then remove from the heat",
"Now, the fun part: Dust your pizza peel with semolina flour or cornmeal. If you don\u2019t have a peel, don\u2019t worry: just use the back of a baking sheet (or a rimless baking sheet) instead. Place your 11-inch round on top of the pizza peel. Use the back of a spoon to spread the 1/2 cup of sauce on the dough, in a thin layer, leaving a 1/2-inch margin at the edge. Top with the mozzarella and the Parm or pecorino cheese, then add the broccoli, shallot and capers. Season with a pinch of salt over the entire pizza",
"Very gently, use the peel (or baking sheet) to give a firm shake and carefully transfer the assembled pie to the pizza stone in the oven. Bake for 6 to 7 minutes, until the cheese has melted and the crust is lightly browned"

"Marinate the chicken: In a medium bowl, whisk together the olive oil, cumin, pepper, turmeric, salt, coriander, cardamom, paprika, garlic powder, oregano, cinnamon, cloves and ginger. Add the chicken thighs and toss to coat, ensuring the spice rub gets into all the folds and crevices of the thighs. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes and up to 12 hours.",
"Make the cabbage salad: While the chicken marinates, in a large bowl, whisk together the olive oil, vinegar, salt, sugar and pepper. Add the cabbage and gently toss to coat. Cover and let sit for at least 30 minutes, or refrigerate for up to 24 hours.",
"Cook the chicken: Heat a large, heavy skillet or grill pan over medium-high heat until almost smoking. Lightly brush the pan with a whisper of oil to coat. Cook the chicken until golden, with crispy edges, 5 to 6 minutes per side. Transfer to a cutting board, let rest for 1 to 2 minutes, then chop into bite-size pieces.",
"Toast the pitas lightly and stuff them with the cabbage salad, chicken, cilantro and pickled onions, if using. Serve right away, with harissa and amba, if using, on the side."

Place a tortilla on the grate above a stove-top burner (or in a dry skillet), then cook on medium heat for a few seconds per side, flipping with tongs, until warmed through and pliable.

"To start this recipe, we\u2019ll soak the dried chickpeas and raw cashews separately to get that perfectly fluffy falafel and creamy sauce. Place the chickpeas in a medium container and cover with 4 cups of water. Place the cashews in a small container and cover with 2 cups of water. Cover both and let them sit for 10 to 12 hours.",
"When the cashew soak is complete, blend that sauce: Drain the nuts and throw them into a blender along with the cilantro, water, lemon juice, salt and cayenne pepper, if using. Whiz it all up until a creamy sauce forms. A high-speed blender is the quickest tool for the job, but a standard blender works, too; it just takes a few minutes longer. You\u2019ll need to eyeball it to get to a creamy consistency; you may need to add an extra tbsp or two of water. Taste, and add another pinch of salt, as needed. Transfer to a container, cover and refrigerate until serving. You should have about 1 1/3 cups.",
"On to the falafel: Warm the garlic in a medium (dry) skillet over medium heat, flipping it once or twice, until just browned, about 2 minutes total. Transfer to a food processor, along with the red onion, carrot, cilantro stems and parsley. Process until finely chopped, about 10 seconds. Scrape down the sides of the bowl.",
"Drain the soaked chickpeas and add them to the food processor, along with the cumin and salt. Process for about 20 seconds total, stopping and scraping down the bowl a few times, until a crumbly dough forms.",
"Take a heaping tbsp of the dough and use your hands to form it into a disk about 2 inches in diameter and just under 1/2-inch thick. Falafel dough is crumbly (not like the consistency of cookie dough), so don\u2019t be alarmed. It takes a little pressing to stay together.",
"Repeat to make 24 disks, placing them on a baking sheet. Because you will be pan-frying and not deep-frying, the flat disk shape will help the falafel get cooked through.",
"Heat the oil in the same skillet you used for the garlic, over medium-high heat. Place a crumb from a falafel disk in the oil, and once it starts to sizzle, the oil is ready. Fry about 8 falafel at a time, for 2 to 3 minutes on each side, until they are lightly browned all over. We like using chopsticks to flip them, and we do it carefully to avoid spattering oil. Transfer the cooked falafel to a plate. Add a bit more oil to keep the bottom of the skillet covered for the next batch.",
"Once the falafel are done, you can eat them immediately, or refrigerate or freeze them.",
"To serve: Stuff each of the pita halves with 3 falafel, cucumber slices, red onion, spinach and tomatoes. Dollop with enough cilantro-cashew sauce to cover the filling, and some harissa, if using."

"There are a few components to prepare for this platter, so we\u2019ll be multitasking! Start with the cauliflower and preheat the oven to 450 degrees. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. ",
"Toss together the cauliflower, oil, thyme, cumin, turmeric, lemon zest and salt in a mixing bowl until evenly coated, then spread in a single layer on the baking sheet. Roast until fork-tender, about 25 minutes. ",
"While that\u2019s roasting, get that quinoa salad cooking: Combine the quinoa, salt and water in a medium saucepan. Bring it to a boil, then cover and cook, gently bubbling, for 13 to 17 minutes, until the water is absorbed and the quinoa is fluffy. Remove from the heat and let stand, covered, for 5 minutes. (If making ahead, refrigerate until serving.)",
"If you\u2019re making the quinoa salad right away, here\u2019s a trick for bringing that steaming hot quinoa to room temperature quickly: Spread it in an even layer on a baking sheet for about 3 minutes. Now, transfer the quinoa to a medium bowl and mix it with the parsley, cherry tomatoes, red bell pepper, lemon juice, oil and black pepper. Taste, and add more salt as needed. The salt should perfectly balance the pop of the lemon!",
"Finally, let\u2019s make those warmed olives. Combine the oil and garlic in a small skillet over medium-low heat. Cook for 1 minute, then add the olives and cook for 5 minutes until warmed through, stirring occasionally. Remove from the heat. Add the thyme, crushing it with your fingers as you sprinkle it over the olives. (You can skip this and go with straight-up olives in a pinch, but it adds great flavor with minimal effort.)",
"Channel your inner Matisse and arrange the roasted cauliflower, quinoa salad, olives, hummus, cucumber slices, almonds and pita wedges on a platter. Garnish the hummus with paprika, if desired"

Add the salt and reduce the heat to low. Cook over low heat, slowly bubbling, for 20 minutes: The mixture will resemble a thick, yellow paste. Turn off the heat and stir in the butter until it has melted.",
