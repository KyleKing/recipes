* >> Cookie Dough Layer
* Cream together butter and sugars until light and fluffy. Mix in vanilla and heavy cream. Add flour and salt and mix until incorporated. Stir in mini chocolate chips. When caramel layer is firm, carefully spread the cookie dough on top

## Notes

* Cut with a hot dry knife before serving. Keep refrigerated in one layer as the caramel layer will start to ooze as these come to room temperature
