Place the flour in a microwave-safe bowl and microwave on high in 30-second intervals, stirring in between. Use an instant-read thermometer to ensure that the flour reaches 165Â°F throughout
* In a stand mixer or using a hand mixer, beat together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy
* Add the vanilla, cream, and salt. Mix to combine. Then add the heat treated flour and mix to incorporate
* Fold in the chocolate chips
