## Ingredients

* [ ] Tart
    * [ ] 1 cup heavy cream
    * [ ] 8 oz semi- or bitter-sweet chocolate, very finely chopped
    * [ ] 1/2 stick (4 tablespoons) unsalted butter, at room temperature and cut into small pieces
    * [ ] Fully baked Butter Crust, in a tart pan (recipe follows)
    * [ ] Lightly sweetened whipped cream
    * [ ] (optional) chocolate shavings, for decoration
* [ ] Crust
    * [ ] 1.25 cups all-purpose flour
    * [ ] 1 tsp sugar
    * [ ] 1/2 tsp salt
    * [ ] 3/4 stick (6 tablespoons) very cold unsalted butter, cut into bits
    * [ ] 1 large egg
    * [ ] 1 tsp ice water

## Recipe

* In a food processor, pulse the flour, sugar and salt. Scatter over the bits of butter and pulse until they’re coarsely chopped into the mix
* In a small bowl, beat the egg and water together, add the mixture to the machine in three parts and pulse after each one (You want a moist dough that holds together when it’s pinched)
* Turn the dough onto a counter, flatten into a disk and place between sheets of parchment or wax paper
* Roll out the dough and fit it into a tart pan. Chill (or freeze) the dough for at least 1 hour before baking
* Preheat the oven to 400°. Press a piece of buttered foil on top of the crust and fill with dry rice or beans
* Place the pan on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat. Bake for 20 minutes, remove the foil and weights and bake for another 10 minutes, or until golden
* Transfer the baking sheet to a rack and let the crust cool to room temperature
* In a small saucepan over low heat, cook the cream and chocolate, stirring, until the chocolate melts and the mixture is smooth (~5 min). Keep the heat low—don’t let it bubble!
* Turn off the heat and leave the pan on the burner. Slowly add the butter, stirring until the butter melts. When melted, the mixture should be a velvety, slightly shiny ganache. Pour it into the crust
* Slide into the fridge and chill until the chocolate is firm (~3 hours). If overnight, cover with plastic wrap
