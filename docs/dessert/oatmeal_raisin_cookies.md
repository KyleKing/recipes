## Ingredients

* [ ] 1 - In a medium bowl, whisk:
    * [ ] 1.75 cups flour
    * [ ] 3/4 tsp baking soda
    * [ ] 3/4 tsp baking powder
    * [ ] 1/2 tsp salt
    * [ ] 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
    * [ ] 1/2 tsp nutmeg
* [ ] 2 - In a large bowl, combine:
    * [ ] 2 sticks butter, room temperature
    * [ ] 1/4 cup sugar
    * [ ] 1.5 cups brown sugar, packed
    * [ ] 2 eggs
    * [ ] 2.5 tsp vanilla
* [ ] 3 - (Combine both bowls) then add:
    * [ ] 3.5 cups oatmeal
    * [ ] 1 cup raisins

## Recipe

* Preheat oven to 350'F
* Whisk part 1. With a wooden spoon combine part 2. Then in the large bowl, combine 1 and 2 then 3
* Bake for 12 minutes (or 14 from frozen) on a light colored cooking sheet. When done, let sit for a few minutes then place on a cooling rack

## Notes

* Source: page 767-768 of the Joy of Cooking
* I typically bake half (1 cookie sheet of 16-24 cookies) then freeze the rest of the dough to make at a later date
* For oatmeal chocolate chip cookies, ignore the nutmeg and cinnamon and use 1 cup chocolate chips instead of raisins
