## Ingredients

* [ ] 9 ounces dark (or semi-sweet) chocolate, either chocolate chips, or bar chocolate cut in small chunks
* [ ] 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, cut up
* [ ] 1.33 cup sugar
* [ ] 5 tbsp flour
* [ ] 1/2 tsp vanilla extract
* [ ] 5 large eggs, room temperature
* [ ] powdered sugar

## Recipe

* Pre-heat the oven to 325F Lightly butter a 10 inch spring-form or tart pan with removable bottom
* Microwave the butter and chocolate a bowl for 1 minute; stir; microwave for another 30 seconds and stir again. If not completely melted, put it back in for another 15 seconds
* Add the sugar, extract, and flour to the chocolate, then the eggs, and whisk to completely break up the eggs. Cover and set aside at room temperature for 30 minutes. The mixture will thicken as it sits
* Pour into the buttered pan and smooth out the batter evenly. Bake for 50-60 minutes, until firm on top and cracks form across the surface. Cool on a rack, then remove the outer ring
* Sift powdered sugar over the top
