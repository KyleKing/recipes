## Ingredients

### Core

* [ ] 1/2 cup heavy cream
* [ ] 2 tbsp Baileys Irish Cream
* [ ] 1 tbsp unsalted butter
* [ ] Pinch salt
* [ ] 8 oz semi-sweet chocolate, chopped

### Recommended Coatings

* [ ] Cocoa powder
* [ ] equal parts cocoa powder and confectioners' sugar
* [ ] finely chopped nuts
* [ ] unsweetened shredded coconut

## Recipe

* In a medium microwave-safe bowl, combine the heavy cream, Baileys, butter, and salt
    * Microwave on high power until the mixture comes to a boil (70-80 sec). Watch that it doesn't boil over
    * Add the chocolate and let sit for about 30 seconds to melt. Using a whisk, stir until the chocolate is completely melted and the mixture is glossy and smooth
    * Refrigerate until completely firm (3 hours or overnight)
* Prep your coating on a plate and a tupperware with parchment paper. Remove the chilled truffle mixture from the refrigerator (may need a few min to slightly warm)
    * Lightly coat fingers with the coating and begin shaping into rough balls. Quickly roll between palms to smooth then roll in topping of choice
    * Place in the tupperware and once all are made, store in the refrigerator
* Remove from the refrigerator about 10 min before serving
