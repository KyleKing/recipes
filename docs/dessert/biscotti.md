## Ingredients

* [ ] 6 tbsp butter
* [ ] 2/3 cup sugar
* [ ] 1/4 tsp salt
* [ ] 2 tsp vanilla extract
* [ ] 1.5 tsp baking powder
* [ ] 2 eggs
* [ ] 2 cups flour
* [ ] 1.5 cups chocolate chips

## Recipe

* Preheat oven to 350. Lightly grease a baking sheet
* In a medium-sized bowl, beat the butter, sugar, salt, vanilla, and baking powder until the mixture is smooth and creamy. Beat in the eggs and add the flower at low speed. Stir until smooth
* Divide the dough in half and with wet hands, shape into two logs 2 in wide, 10 in long, and about 1 in thick
* Bake for 25-30 minutes, remove, and allow to cool for 30 minutes. Carefully transfer to a cutting board
* Reduce the oven temperature to 325
* With a wet paper towel, lightly dampen the logs and wait another 5 minutes before using a serrated knife to slice into 1/2-3/4 in. wide biscotti. Note that putting too much vertical pressure with the knife can cause the biscotti to crumble. Make sure to move the knife back and forth instead
* Return the slices to the baking sheet, standing them up with 1/2 in between them so air can circulate. Return the biscotti to the oven and bake for 25-30 minutes, until they feel very dry and are beginning to turn golden. Transfer them to a rack to cool

## Notes

* The King Arthur website has a number of tasty recipes like chocolate dipped biscotti
