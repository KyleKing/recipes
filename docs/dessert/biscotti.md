## Ingredients

* [ ] 6 tbsp butter
* [ ] 2/3 cup sugar
* [ ] 1/4 tsp salt
* [ ] 2 tsp vanilla extract
* [ ] 1.5 tsp baking powder
* [ ] 2 eggs
* [ ] 2 cups flour
* [ ] 1.5 cups chocolate chips

## Recipe

* In the large glass bowl, beat the butter, sugar, salt, vanilla, and baking powder until the mixture is smooth and creamy
* Beat in the eggs and add the flour at low speed. Stir until smooth. Will be sticky
* *Preheat oven to 350*
    * Place parchment paper on or lightly grease a baking sheet
    * Divide the dough in half and with wet hands, shape into two logs 2 in wide, 10 in long, and about 1 in thick
    * Bake for 25-30 minutes, remove, and allow to cool for 30 minutes
* Reduce the oven temperature to 325
    * Carefully transfer to a cutting board
    * Cover logs with a damp towel and wait another ~5 min before using a serrated knife to slice into 1/2" - 3/4" wide biscotti
    * Make sure to saw the knife back and forth. Putting too much vertical pressure with the knife can cause the biscotti to crumble
* Return the slices to the baking sheet, standing them up with 1/2" space between them so that air can circulate
* Return the biscotti to the oven and bake for 25-30 minutes, until they feel very dry and are beginning to turn golden
* Transfer to a rack to cool

## Notes

* The King Arthur website has a number of tasty recipes like chocolate dipped biscotti
