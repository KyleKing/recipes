## Recipe

* Preheat the oven to 375. Grease an 8-in square baking dish cooking oil spray
* In a medium bowl, mix together 1/2 cup of the pecans, 2 tbsp of the coconut, 1/4 tsp of the cinnamon, the brown sugar, and a pinch of salt
* In a large mixing bowl, stir together the oats, baking powder, 1/2 tsp of salt, and the remaining 3/4 tsp of cinnamon
* In a liquid measuring cup, whisk together the milk, maple syrup, egg, oil and vanilla extract

* Bake for 40-45 minutes or until golden at the edges and set at the center. Serve warm.

## Notes

* Note: each serving contains 23g of sugar... I would like to try to cut that down
