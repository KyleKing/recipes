## Ingredients

* [ ] 2 cups all-purpose flour
* [ ] 2 teaspoons baking powder
* [ ] 1/4 teaspoon salt
* [ ] 1 tablespoon sugar
* [ ] 2 eggs
* [ ] 1.5 cups milk
* [ ] 2 tablespoons melted and cooled butter

## Recipe

* Mix dry ingredients in a bowl
* Combine 1.5 cups milk and butter (melted and let cool). Gently mix in the eggs.
* Gently stir the liquid mix into the dry ingredient bowl. {Don't overwork and gently mix until mostly combined. If batter seems thick, add a little more milk}
* Spray a griddle or large skillet and heat over medium-low heat
* Measure out 1/3 cup of batter. Flip when bubbles begin to form on the edges (2-4 minutes), then lightly brown on the opposite side
* The pancakes are best cooked without anything inside. So add the blueberries and other toppings after

## Notes

* Try adding: oatmeal, chopped walnuts, peanut butter, flaxseed, banana, blueberry
