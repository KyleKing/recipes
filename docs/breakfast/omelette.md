## Ingredients

* [ ] 3 eggs
* [ ] chive
* [ ] basil

## Recipe

* Beat the eggs together until homogeneous + pinch of salt
* Over medium-low heat, melt the butter in a skillet, then pour in the eggs.
* Using a rubber spatula, constantly scrape the bottom of the pan while shaking the pan in a circular motion to ensure that the eggs cook slowly, forming only small curds, about 1-2 minutes.
* Once you start to see the bottom of the pan for more than a second after scraping, push the eggs into a round circular shape. Cook until the edges solidify, then tilt the pan and carefully roll the omelette on itself.
* Invert onto a plate, then sprinkle with chives
