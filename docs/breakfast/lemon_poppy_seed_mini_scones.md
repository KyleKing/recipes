## Ingredients

* [ ] 1 fresh lemon, *for 1 tsp zest and 1 tbsp juice*
* [ ] 1.25 cups all-purpose flour
* [ ] 1/2 tsp salt
* [ ] 1/4 and 1/2 cup powdered sugar, divided
* [ ] 2 tsp baking powder
* [ ] 2 tsp poppy seeds
* [ ] 1 cup heavy whipping cream

## Recipe

* Preheat oven to 400ÂºF and line a baking sheet with parchment. Prep the lemon and place the zest and juice separately to the side
* In a large bowl, stir together the flour, salt, *1/4* cup powdered sugar, baking powder, poppy seeds, and 1 tsp lemon zest
* Stir the cream into the dry ingredients until a shaggy ball of dough forms. The dough will be fairly sticky. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface, divide it into three pieces, and shape each piece into a disc (about 3 inches diameter). Cut each disc into six triangles.
* Arrange the cut scones on the prepared baking sheet. Bake the scones for about 15 minutes, or until they just begin to barely turn golden brown on top.
* While the scones are baking, place the remaining 1/2 cup powdered sugar in a bowl. Stir in about 1 Tbsp lemon juice, or just enough to form a thick glaze.
* When the scones have baked, remove them from the oven, let them cool, then drizzle with the prepared lemon glaze.
