## Ingredients

* [ ] IKEA Meatballs!
* [ ] IKEA Meatball Sauce Packet

## Recipe

* Getting the meatball sauce packet is tricky. I found that adding a little bit of salt then thoroughly mixing provides the best change of achieving a smooth consistency

## Notes

* Note: source is for actually making meatballs and not just defrosting IKEA :)
