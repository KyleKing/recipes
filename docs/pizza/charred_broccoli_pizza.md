## Recipe

* For the crust: Whisk together the flour, salt and yeast in a bowl or the bowl of your stand mixer. Stir to combine. Add the water and oil, stirring until a shaggy dough forms. Turn it out onto a floured surface
* Knead the dough by pushing with the base of your palm, then re-forming it into a ball. Continue kneading for 8 minutes until the dough feels pillowy and has a smooth, stretchy exterior. If the dough is very sticky, add a small amount of flour while kneading
* Alternatively, attach the dough hook to your stand mixer and start the mixer on medium-low speed, then allow the mixer to knead for 8 minutes
* After the kneading is finished, divide the dough into 3 equal pieces. Use floured hands to gently shape each piece into a boule (ball shape) by folding the dough under itself. Set each boule on a floured surface and dab the dough with a bit of oil to keep it moist. Cover all boules with a damp towel and allow them to rise until doubled in size, about 45 minutes to 1 hour
* The dough is ready to be used. However for the best flavor, transfer the dough to separate sealed containers, large enough for the dough to double in size again, and store in the refrigerator for 2 to 3 days
* If you’re using the dough after refrigerating: The day of serving, remove the dough from the containers, place it on a lightly floured surface covered with a towel and allow it to come to room temperature before stretching, 30 to 45 minutes
* To stretch the dough, place it on a lightly floured surface and gently press it into a round, flipping several times and adding a pinch of flour if it is too sticky. Once it is about 8 inches in diameter, pick up the dough and gently drape it over the knuckles on both of your hands. Slowly rotate it around, allowing gravity to stretch it into a round about 11 inches in diameter. Do not overwork or fold the dough. If the dough starts to resist stretching, put it down and allow it to rest for a few minutes, at which point it will stretch more easily
* When you're ready to bake your pizza, preheat the oven with a pizza stone in it to 500 degrees, or its highest number setting
* For the sauce: This sauce takes just 2 minutes to make. Stir together the tomatoes, garlic powder, dried oregano, salt, oil and crushed red pepper flakes in a medium bowl. The yield is 1 cup; reserve half for another use
* For the topping: Heat the oil in a small skillet until it’s shimmering over medium-high heat. Add the broccoli and cook for 1 minute, then add 1/2 cup water and cover. Cook/steam for 3 to 4 minutes, until tender. Drain the water. Stir in the lemon juice and the 1/8 tsp of salt, then remove from the heat
* Now, the fun part: Dust your pizza peel with semolina flour or cornmeal. If you don’t have a peel, don’t worry: just use the back of a baking sheet (or a rimless baking sheet) instead. Place your 11-inch round on top of the pizza peel. Use the back of a spoon to spread the 1/2 cup of sauce on the dough, in a thin layer, leaving a 1/2-inch margin at the edge. Top with the mozzarella and the Parm or pecorino cheese, then add the broccoli, shallot and capers. Season with a pinch of salt over the entire pizza
* Very gently, use the peel (or baking sheet) to give a firm shake and carefully transfer the assembled pie to the pizza stone in the oven. Bake for 6 to 7 minutes, until the cheese has melted and the crust is lightly browned
