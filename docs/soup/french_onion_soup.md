## Ingredients

*Note*: this recipe has been cut in half

- [ ] 1.5 Tbsp olive oil
- [ ] 3.5 Tbsp butter
- [ ] 5 cups *yellow* onions (~1.5 lbs), thinly sliced
- [ ] 3 thyme sprigs, bound with Chef's twine
- [ ] 4 cloves garlic
- [ ] 1 Tbsp flour
- [ ] 1/2 cup dry red wine or 2 Tbsp red wine vinegar
- [ ] 3 cups beef broth
- [ ] 3/4 Tbsp Worcestershire or Soy sauce
- [ ] 1/2 tsp kosher salt
- [ ] baguette, cut into bite-size cubes
- [ ] 6 oz Gruyere or swiss cheese, grated

## Recipe

- In a Cuisinart, attach a 4mm blade and thinly slice the onions (and then can reuse the Cuisinart for grating the cheese)
- In pot, heat the oil and butter on high. Add the onions and thyme. Stir often and cook for ~15 minutes until the onions begin to shrink, but light in color
- Reduce the heat to medium, add the garlic and cook until the onions are golden brown and tender (~20 min)
- Add the flour and cook for about 3 min
- Increase the heat to medium, add the wine and bring to a boil. Cook until evaporated (~5 min). Discard the Thyme
- Increase the heat to high, add the broth, Worcestershire sauce, and salt. Bring to a boil then reduce to a simmer. Simmer for 45 minutes
- While simmering, preheat the oven to 400F. Bake the bite-size bread chunks for ~6 min
- Set the oven to broil. Add 1/4 cup cheese in the bottom of two oven-safe soup crocks. Add the soup, the baguette crisps, then cover with the remaining cheese
    - Broil until the cheese slightly browns and begins bubbling
