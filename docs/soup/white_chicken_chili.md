## Recipe

- In a large Dutch oven, heat the olive oil over medium heat
    - Add the onion and jalape単o and cook, stirring often, until the onions are tender, about 6 minutes
    - Add the garlic, oregano, cumin, paprika, cayenne, salt and a few grinds of black pepper, and cook for 1 minute, until fragrant
- Add the chicken broth, cannellini beans, and diced green chiles with their liquid; bring to a boil over medium-high heat
    - Lower the heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the broth has reduced by about half, 18-20 minutes
    - Off the heat, use a wooden spoon to mash some of the beans against the side of the pot. Continue mashing the beans until the broth is noticeably thicker
- Return the pot to medium, stir in the chicken and corn, and cook until heated through, about 3 minutes
    - Juice the lime half over the pot, then taste for seasonings and add more salt, black pepper, and cayenne, if desired.
- Serve the chili in bowls topped as you like with a lime wedge, shredded cheese, pickled jalape単os, diced avocado, sour cream, chopped fresh cilantro, and/or crushed tortilla chips
