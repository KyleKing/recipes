## Ingredients

- [ ] 2-3 Leeks
- [ ] 1 tbsp olive oil
- [ ] 2 carrots, thinly sliced
- [ ] 2 tbsp flour
- [ ] 3/4 cup white wine
- [ ] 1/2 cup low-sodium chicken broth
- [ ] 2 tsp dried thyme or 4 whole thyme sprigs
- [ ] 1.5 lb golden potatoes, quartered
- [ ] 1.5 lb boneless skinless chicken thighs
- [ ] 2 cups frozen peas, thawed
- [ ] salt and pepper
- [ ] (optional) parsley
- [ ] Instant Pot

## Recipe

- Trim the bottom roots and tough upper green from leeks. Thinly slice into rounds. Submerge in a bowl of cold water and shake to remove grit. Lift out the sliced leeks by hand and dry in a colander, change the water and re-submerge/shake. Repeat until clean
- In an Instant Pot, heat the oil on saute. Add leeks and carrots. Cook 5 min until golden, stirring occasionally.
- Stir in the flour. Add the white wine, chicken broth, thyme, potatoes, salt, and pepper. Top with chicken.
- Seal and set to high pressure. Cook 10 and natural release 10 min (set out frozen peas to defrost)
- Stir in peas and let sit 2 min (remove any thyme stems). Season with additional salt and pepper
- (optional) garnish with parsley

## Notes

- For frozen boneless, skinless chicken thighs, put in without thawing. Keep potatoes whole and increase cook time from 10 to 20-25 min

- Replace white wine with the same volume of chicken broth and add squeeze of lemon juice instead
