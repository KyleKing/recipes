## Ingredients

- [ ] 3 tbsp Olive Oil
- [ ] 1 medium onion, cut into 1/2-in rough dice
- [ ] 4 cloves garlic, chopped
- [ ] 1 (28 oz) can whole peeled tomatoes in juice, roughly chopped
- [ ] 1 cup low sodium chicken or vegetable broth
- [ ] 1/2 tsp sugar
- [ ] 1/2 tsp pepper
- [ ] 1/4 cup heavy cream
- [ ] Side bread

## Recipe

- In the dutch oven, heat oil and cook the onion until translucent (about 10 min). Add the garlic and cook an additional minute
- Add the tomatoes, juice, broth, sugar, and 1/2 tsp pepper
- Bring to a boil then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer gently until liquid reduces slightly (~15 min)
- Removing the pot from heat, use an immersion blender to blend the soup until smooth (alternatively, use a regular blender, but you'll need to let the soup cool for longer and be careful about allowing the steam to escape while blending)
    - Add the heavy cream and blend for a few more seconds
- Season with additional salt, pepper, and/or sugar to taste
