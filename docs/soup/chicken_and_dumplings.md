## Ingredients

* [ ] soup
    * [ ] 2 cups broth, split
    * [ ] 2 lbs skinless chicken breasts
    * [ ] 1.5 cups frozen peas
    * [ ] 2 tbsp unsalted butter
    * [ ] 3 large carrots, coined
    * [ ] 2 celery stalks, coined
    * [ ] 1 yellow onion, diced
    * [ ] 1 tsp kosher salt
* [ ] dumplings
    * [ ] 1 cup all-purpose flour
    * [ ] 1/2 cup bread crumbs
    * [ ] 2 tsp baking powder
    * [ ] 3/4 tsp kosher salt
    * [ ] 1/2 tsp pepper
    * [ ] 1 small shallot, minced
    * [ ] 1.5 tbsp parsley, finely chopped
    * [ ] 1/3 cup whole milk
    * [ ] 1 large egg
    * [ ] 2 tbsp unsalted butter, melted (~20s in microwave)

## Recipe

* Prep the vegetables
* Arrange the chicken breasts in a single layer with 1 cup of broth in the instant pot. Set to Meat or Poultry for 7-8 min & high pressure
* Make the dumpling dough: In a bowl, stir together the flour, bread crumbs, baking powder, salt, pepper, shallot, and parsley.
* In the center of the mixture, add the milk, egg, and melted butter. With a fork, gradually mix the dry ingredients into the wet until evenly absorbed. Cover and place in the fridge
* Quick release the chicken and transfer to the cutting board. Pour the broth into a microwave-safe tupperware (you can store leftovers in it later) and combine with the peas and remaining cup of broth
* Select the saute option and melt 2 tbsp of butter, then add carrots, celery, onion, and salt. Saute for 5 minutes. In parallel, microwave the broth and peas for 3 minutes
* Shred the chicken into bite-size pieces
* Return the shredded chicken and the hot broth and peas to the pot. Add more broth if needed until at least submerged
* Add large tablespoons of the dumpling dough, spacing evenly
* Cover the pot with a glass lid and cook for 15 minutes

* Source: The Essential Instant Pot Cookbook page 55
* TO make breadcrumbs, leave bread out uncovered to dry, then freeze. When you need it, just microwave it for 20 seconds and toss in a food processor (definitely don't use a grater...)
