## Ingredients

* [ ] 1 tbsp yeast
* [ ] 1 tbsp white sugar
* [ ] 2 cups warm water (microwaved for 30 seconds)
* [ ] 4 cups flour
* [ ] 1 cup flour, mixed with 1 tbsp. salt
* [ ] ~1/2 tbsp Olive Oil for bowl when proofing
* [ ] 6 cups water + 1/3 cup baking soda
* [ ] Toppings: extra coarse salt / cinnamon and brown sugar

## Recipe

* In large bowl, stir yeast, sugar and warm water. Let rest until yeast is dissolved and is a little foamy
* With a wood spoon, stir in flour one cup at a time. Then add the salt and flour mixture
* Prepare a floured cutting board and knead until smooth (3-4 minutes)
* Add ~1/2 tbsp oil to the original bowl and roll around until coated
* Cover the bowl and proof until doubled in size (about ~60 minutes depending on temp)
* Remove and briefly knead. Cut into 8 pieces, roll each piece into 30-36" long ropes
    * Carefully stretch and roll to avoid tearing
    * Once long enough, loop, rotate, and pinch down in a pretzel shape
    * Transfer to a lightly greased light colored baking sheet
* Cover with a towel and let rise for 15 minutes
* Meanwhile, start bowling the water and baking soda
* With a spatula and slotted spoon carefully dip each pretzel for 30 seconds. Return to the baking sheet
* Sprinkle with the selected toppings
* Bake for 21 minutes at 425F (preheat as needed)
