## Ingredients

### Dough

* [ ] 8 g instant yeast
* [ ] 375 g water
* [ ] 500 g flour
* [ ] 10 g salt
* [ ] olive oil

### Topping

* [ ] 1/4 cup olive oil
* [ ] 1 tsp flaky sea salt

## Recipe

* *Create the Dough*: follow the [Base Recipe for No-Knead Bread](./base_recipe_for_no_knead_bread.md) through step 8
* *Shape*: Oil a 16x24 in rimmed baking sheet
* Pull the dough out of the bowl and drop directly on the sheet
* Pour the 1/4 cup of olive oil over the dough and start *gently* stretching the dough. Add dimples and sprinkle the sea salt
* Let the dough rest in the pan and preheat the oven to 475F
* Set one oven rack in the center position and one in the lowest
* Place a roasting pan on the bottom shelf and let it preheat
* *Bake*
* Pour hot water into the roasting pan
* Slide the dough onto the center rack and bake with steam for 10 min
* Carefully remove the roasting pan and water and replace with a a baking sheet (for our oven, this prevent the bottom of the bread from burning)

* *Cool*: Let the focaccia cool on the baking sheet for 20 minutes before cutting into squares
