## Ingredients

### For the rice

- [ ] 1½ cups pho broth (or any type of broth or water if you don’t have pho)
- [ ] 1 cup long-grain red rice
- [ ] 1 bay leaf
- [ ] Salt
- [ ] Pepper

### For the vegetables

- [ ] 2 avocados
- [ ] Juice of ½ lime
- [ ] Flake salt and pepper to taste
- [ ] Olive oil
- [ ] 4 cups assorted vegetables (broccoli, cabbage, bean sprouts, mushrooms, onions)
- [ ] 1 lime, quartered
- [ ] Garnishes of choice: leftover takeout or peanut sauce, hoisin, purple basil, a fried or poached egg, kimchi, sauerkraut, or any other type of pickled vegetable.

## Recipe

- Combine all the ingredients for the rice and follow the cooking instructions on the package or for your rice cooker.
- Mash the avocados. Season with the lime juice, salt, and pepper, and set aside.
- Preheat a large sauté pan over medium-high heat. Add a thin layer of olive oil once the pan is hot to just coat the bottom of the pan. Sear the vegetables, cooking in batches by individual type, until they are charred on one side. Remove to a plate on the side.
- Season with salt and pepper. Divide the rice among four bowls. Serve the vegetables on top of the rice. Garnish with lime wedges and any other garnishes you like.
