## Ingredients

* [ ] 3/4 cup cocoa powder
* [ ] 1/2 cup sugar
* [ ] 1/3 cup packed brown sugar
* [ ] pinch salt
* [ ] 1 cup whole milk
* [ ] 2 cups heavy cream
* [ ] 1/2 tbsp vanilla extract

## Recipe

* In a large bowl, whisk together the dry ingredients. Add the milk and beat until combined.
* (Make sure to mix thoroughly before adding the heavy cream)
* Gently mix in the heavy cream and vanilla. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour (preferably overnight)
* Pour the mixture into the ice cream maker and let spin until thickened (15-20 min)

## Notes

* Goes great with crushed up Oreos (crush up and mix in after starting to thicken)
* After freezing for 1-2 hours, you can swirl warm peanut butter in with a knife (thin with powdered sugar)
