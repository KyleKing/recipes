## Recipe

* Use Coconut Milk and limit to recipes that a coconut flavor works with
    * Alternatives to Coconut Milk are adding fat through oil and blending to incorporate
* Sufficient Sugar is important. See recipes like [https://www.seriouseats.com/vegan-vanilla-ice-cream](https://www.seriouseats.com/vegan-vanilla-ice-cream)
    * Including corn syrup instead of granulated can make for a smoother texture
* Stabilizers like eggs or corn starch can help ice crystals from continuing to form and ice cream hardening when stored in the freezer for a few days
    * A splash of alcohol can help as well
