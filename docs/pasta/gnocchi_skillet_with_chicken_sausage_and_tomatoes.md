## Ingredients

* [ ] 1 lb frozen or shelf-stable gnocchi
* [ ] salt and pepper
* [ ] 9 oz cooked chicken sausage (about 3 links), 1/4" coins
* [ ] 1 pint cherry or grape tomatoes, sliced in half lengthwise
* [ ] 1-2 oz fresh basil leaves, thinly sliced (1/2 - 1 cup loosely packed)

## Recipe

* Boil water and cook the gnocchi for 2 min (package directions)
* Drain and toss with a drizzle of olive oil
* Heat a 10-inch or larger cast iron skillet over medium heat with a light drizzle of olive oil. Add the sausages and cook until beginning to brown (2-3 min)
* Push the sausages into a pile at the edge of the skillet and turn the heat up to high
* When the skillet is quite hot, add the tomatoes, skin down, crowding them in if necessary. Cook until they are blistered (1-2 min)
* Stir in the sausage and cook until both tomatoes and sausage are slightly browned, (~2 min)
* Stir in gnocchi and cook until all is combined, but the tomatoes have not broken down into sauce
* Remove the skillet from the heat and stir in the basil
* Taste and season with salt and pepper

## Notes

* Any cooked chicken sausage can be used, but flavored ones with red pepper or garlic work best
