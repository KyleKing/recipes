## Ingredients

* [ ] 9 oz. fettuccine or egg noodles
* [ ] 3 cloves garlic, minced
* [ ] 1 tbsp butter
* [ ] 2 tsp olive oil
* [ ] 2 cups seafood stock or water
* [ ] 1.25 cups whole milk
* [ ] 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese, grated
* [ ] 1 cup broccoli florets, chopped
* [ ] salt and pepper
* [ ] parsley, chopped

## Recipe

* Saute garlic in the butter and olive oil over medium heat for a few min
* Add the uncooked noodles, stock/water, milk, and broccoli. Bring to a boil and cover
* Once boiling, cook for ~3 min, then simmer for 8 min or until most of the liquid has reduced
* Toss in cheese and cook for another ~8 min
* Season with salt and pepper and garnish with chopped parsley and cheese

## Notes

* I think I made this recipe with whole milk, but probably could still work with skim
