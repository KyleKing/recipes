## Ingredients

- [ ] 1 to 2 large butternut squash (at least 3½ cups puréed)
- [ ] 1 cup plus 1 tablespoon cornstarch
- [ ] 3 tablespoons butter, unsalted
- [ ] 1 small can (7.75 ounces) chickpeas, rinsed and drained
- [ ] 1 tablespoon harissa
- [ ] 2 tablespoons parsley, minced
- [ ] Salt
- [ ] Pepper

## Recipe

- To prepare the gnocchi, remove the peel, fibers, and seeds of the butternut squash. Cut into medium-size chunks. Place in a large pot and cover with water. Bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer and cook the squash pieces until they are tender when pierced with a fork.
- Drain the squash, let it cool, then puree until very smooth. If the mixture isn’t completely smooth, push it through a strainer.
- Measure out 3½ cups of butternut puree. Gently mix with the cornstarch. The mixture will look loose, but this is normal and it will firm up during the cooking.
- Bring a large pot of water to a light simmer. Using a small scooper, scoop out batches of the purée and drop them into the pot. Do not crowd the pot; make sure each there is an inch in between each gnocchi. Gently cook each batch for 1 to 2 minutes until the gnocchi float to the top. Remove the gnocchi from the water with a strainer or slotted spoon and place on an oiled sheet pan. Let cool and refrigerate for at least 2 hours before use.
- To serve, bring a large pot of water to a boil. Lower the temperature to a simmer. Drop the gnocchi in to reheat for about 30 seconds. In a large frying pan heat the butter, chickpeas, and harissa. Once the mixture becomes fragrant, add the gnocchi and sauté for 1 minute. Season with salt and pepper. Divide among four plates, sprinkle with parsley, and serve immediately.
