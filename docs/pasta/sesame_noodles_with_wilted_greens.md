## Ingredients

* [ ] 8 oz spaghetti
* [ ] 1/2 bag of spinach (4 oz)
* [ ] 2 eggs
* [ ] olive oil
* [ ] 2 cloves garlic, minced
* [ ] 1/4 cup soy sauce
* [ ] 1 tbsp toasted sesame oil
* [ ] 1/3 tbsp cider vinegar (or 1/2 tbsp rice vinegar)
* [ ] 1 tbsp sesame seeds
* [ ] 1/2 tbsp red pepper flakes

## Recipe

* Start a large pot of boiling water
* Combine soy sauce, sesame oil, cider vinegar, sesame seeds, red pepper flakes, and half of the garlic in a small bowl then set aside
* In a large skillet over medium heat, sauté the other half of the garlic in olive oil (about 1 min). Then add the spinach and sauté until wilted (the spinach should still be bright green and look slightly plump). Season with salt & pepper and remove from heat.
* Once the pot of water is boiling, cook the pasta, drain, then with the heat off, mix the sauce and pasta. Keep the lid on to keep the pot warm
* In parallel prep the scrambled eggs, then combine and serve
