## Ingredients

* [ ] 1 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
* [ ] kosher salt and black pepper
* [ ] 1 yellow onion, chopped
* [ ] 3 carrots, chopped
* [ ] 1 lb boneless chicken breasts, cut into cubes
* [ ] 2 tbsp salted butter
* [ ] 1.5 cups basmati or jasmine rice
* [ ] 1/2 cup dry orzo pasta
* [ ] 2 tbsp fresh thyme leaves, plus more for topping
* [ ] 3.5 cups low sodium chicken broth
* [ ] 3 cups broccoli florets (fresh or frozen), roughly chopped
* [ ] 2 bay leaves
* [ ] 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
* [ ] 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper, more or less to taste
* [ ] 1/2 lemon, zest
* [ ] 1/2 cup whole milk
* [ ] 1.5 cups shredded sharp cheddar cheese
* [ ] peas or other frozen vegetables. Pretty much anything works

## Recipe

* Preheat the oven to 425
* Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. When the oil shimmers, add the onion and carrot and cook until fragrant, about 5 minutes. Stir in the chicken and season with salt and pepper. Cook until the chicken is seared, 2-3 minutes. Add the butter, rice, orzo, and thyme, and cook until golden and toasted, 2-3 minutes. Add the broth and bring to a boil over high heat. Add the broccoli, bay leaves, garlic powder, cayenne, and a large pinch each of salt and pepper. Bring to a boil, cover and reduce heat to low. Cook, covered for 20-25 minutes, until the rice is mostly cooked
* Once the rice is cooked, stir in the lemon zest, milk, and 1/2 cup of cheese. If needed, transfer the rice to an oven-safe casserole dish. Scatter the remaining cheese over top the casserole
* Transfer to the oven and bake 15-20 minutes, until the cheese is melted and just beginning to brown. Serve warm with additional thyme and fresh basil
