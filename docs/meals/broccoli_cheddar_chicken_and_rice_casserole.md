## Ingredients

- [ ] 1 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
- [ ] dash of kosher salt and black pepper
- [ ] 1 yellow onion, chopped
- [ ] 3 carrots, chopped
- [ ] 1 lb boneless chicken breasts, cut into cubes
- [ ] 2 tbsp salted butter
- [ ] 1.5 cups basmati or jasmine rice
- [ ] 1/2 cup dry orzo pasta
- [ ] 2 tsp dried thyme
- [ ] 3.5 cups low sodium chicken broth
- [ ] 3 cups broccoli florets (fresh or frozen), roughly chopped (or other substitute frozen vegetable)
- [ ] 2 bay leaves
- [ ] 1/2 tsp garlic powder
- [ ] 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper, more or less to taste
- [ ] 1/2 lemon, zest (or 2.5 tbsp lemon juice)
- [ ] 1/2 cup milk
- [ ] 1.5 cups shredded sharp cheddar cheese, divided

## Recipe

- Saute the onion and carrot and cook until fragrant, about 5 minutes
- Stir in the chicken and season with salt and pepper and cook until seared, 2-3 minutes
- Add the butter, rice, orzo, and thyme, and cook until golden and toasted, 2-3 minutes
- Add the broth and bring to a boil over high heat
- Preheat the oven to 425
- Add the broccoli, bay leaves, garlic powder, cayenne, a 1/4 tsp of salt, and plenty of pepper. Bring to a boil, cover and reduce heat to low. Cook, covered for 20-25 minutes, until the rice is mostly cooked
- Once the rice is cooked, stir in the lemon zest, milk, and 1/2 cup of cheese. Transfer the rice to an oven-safe casserole dish. Scatter the remaining cheese over top the casserole
- Transfer to the oven and bake 15-20 minutes, until the cheese is melted and just beginning to brown. Serve warm with additional thyme and fresh basil

## Notes

- To Make Ahead: Prepare the casserole and refrigerate. Let warm while pre-heating the oven and bake for 15-20 minutes as recommended
