## Ingredients

- [ ] Standalone
    - [ ] 12 oz lasagna noodles
    - [ ] 1.5 lb sliced or shredded mozzarella
    - [ ] (optional) 1-2 cup spinach
- [ ] Meat/Sauce
    - [ ] (optional) 1 lb ground beef (and/or spicy sausage)
    - [ ] 2 cloves garlic, minced
    - [ ] 1 tsp dried oregano
    - [ ] 2 tsp basil
    - [ ] Kosher salt
    - [ ] Freshly ground black pepper
    - [ ] 1-2 (32 oz) jars of marinara
- [ ] Ricotta Cheese Mix
    - [ ] 16 oz whole milk ricotta
    - [ ] 1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan
    - [ ] 1/4 cup chopped parsley
- [ ] Garnish
    - [ ] 1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan
    - [ ] 1/4 cup chopped parsley

## Recipe

- On med-high heat, cook the meat (ground beef or spinach), breaking into small pieces with a wooden spoon until no longer pink
- If the noodles need to be boiled, prep boiling water and cook for only ~2 minutes until very al dente. May need to coat with a small amount of olive oil to prevent sticking
- Pre-heat oven to 375
- Drain and paper towel off any excess fat. In the same pan, add garlic, spices (oregano, basil, salt, and pepper), and 1 jar of marinara sauce (save the rest)
- In a mixing bowl, combine the ricotta, Parmesan, and parsley. Season with salt and pepper
- In a large casserole dish, spread thin layers of meat sauce/noodles/ricotta mix/sliced mozzarella. Repeat about 4 times until all of the noodles are used (ricotta should finish on n-1 layers). If needed, add additional marinara sauce
- Top last layer of noodles with meat sauce, then Parmesan and mozzarella
- Cover with foil and bake for 15 minutes. Increase to 400 and bake uncovered for 20 min - \*see notes for aluminum pans
- Garnish with parsley and basil

## Notes

- In a dark aluminum pan, i needed to extend the cook time from 15 covered/20 uncovered min to 25/35 min to soften the noodles, which came pre-cooked
