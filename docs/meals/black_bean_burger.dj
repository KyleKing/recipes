## Ingredients

- [ ] 2x 15-oz cans of black beans, drained and rinsed
- [ ] Generous 1 cup chickpea flour
- [ ] 3 Tbsp tomato paste
- [ ] 2 Tbsp plain, unsweetened applesauce
- [ ] 1 tsp chili powder
- [ ] 2 tsp tamari
- [ ] 2 tsp apple cider vinegar
- [ ] 2 Tbsp fresh lime juice
- [ ] 1/2 tsp salt
- [ ] 1/2 tsp black pepper
- [ ] Vegetable oil, for shallow frying
- [ ] 8 whole wheat buns
- [ ] Toppings such as cheese, slices of tomato or onion, pickles, mustard and/or ketchup

## Recipe

- Use a fork to mash the beans in a large mixing bowl so they're mushy but not totally smooth. There should still be some whole beans in the mixture
- Add the chickpea flour, tomato paste, applesauce, chili powder, tamari, vinegar, lime juice, salt, and pepper, stirring to incorporate
- In a skillet, pour a thin layer of oil and heat on medium heat
- Place a generous 1/3 cup of the mixture in the center of the pan. Carefully press it into a round, pressing until the patty is about 3/4 inch thick. Repeat to form 2-4 burgers
- Cook until browned and crisp on both sides (1-2 min per side). Flip as needed so that they cook evenly
- Serve on buns, with cheese, slices of tomato and onion, pickles, mustard, and/or ketchup
