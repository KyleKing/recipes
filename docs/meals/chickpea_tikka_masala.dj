## Ingredients

- [ ] 1 Cauliflower
- [ ] 1 Tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
- [ ] 1/2 tsp fine sea salt
- [ ] 1 medium yellow onion, diced
- [ ] 1/2 tsp ground ginger
- [ ] 3 cloves garlic, minced
- [ ] 1 Tbsp garam masala ([../sides/spices_garam_masala.md](../meals/spices_garam_masala.md))
- [ ] 1/4 tsp ground cayenne pepper
- [ ] 2x 15 oz can chickpeas, rinsed and drained
- [ ] 1 28oz can of crushed tomatoes
- [ ] 3/4 cup canned coconut milk (half of a can)
- [ ] 8 oz bag of spinach
- [ ] 1/2 cup cilantro, chopped (optional)
- [ ] Cooked basmati rice or warmed Naan, for serving

## Recipe

- In an Instant Pot, pour in 1 cup of water and place the cauliflower on a trivet. Set cook time to zero and seal the vent. When at pressure, quick release to avoid overcooking. Alternatively, place the florets in a microwave safe bowl with 1-2 Tbsp of water and microwave for four minutes
- Carefully trim florets from the Cauliflower into bite-size pieces and set the leaves aside
- Rinse the chickpeas, mince the garlic, and, if using, start cooking the rice or prepare to warm the Naan in a cast iron pan or toaster
- Heat the oil in a large, nonreactive skillet medium heat. Add the cauliflower florets, onion, and salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are soft and translucent and the cauliflower is slightly charred (~7 min)
- Add the ginger and garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute
- Add the garam masala and additional cayenne. Stir until fragrant (~30s)
- Add the tomatoes, chickpeas, coconut milk, spinach, and cilantro
- Increase the heat to medium-high; once the mixture begins bubbling around the edges, reduce the heat to low to maintain a gentle bubbling
- Cook, stirring occasionally, until the sauce thickens (20 min)
- Serve on rice or with a side of naan. Sprinkle with more chopped cilantro if using
