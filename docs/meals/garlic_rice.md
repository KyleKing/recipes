## Ingredients

- [ ] Handful of garlic cloves, minced & divided
- [ ] Few garlic cloves, thinly sliced
- [ ] Cooking oil
- [ ] 1 part rice
- [ ] 2 parts water
- [ ] Salt

## Recipe

- In a sauce pot, add one-half of your minced garlic, the dry rice, and tsp of oil
    - Saute for about a minute or until the garlic and rice are toasty and fragrant.
- Add the water and a sprinkle of salt. Simmer, covered, until the water is absorbed and the rice is cooked through
    - While the rice is simmering, add the slices of garlic to a thin layer of cooking oil and fry until golden, but not dark brown (garlic goes bitter) and drain on a paper towel. Season with a sprinkle of salt.
- When the rice is finished cooking, mix in the raw minced garlic for extra pungency. This will give you the fresh flavor paired with the cooked garlic in the rice. Garnish with crispy garlic chips on top for texture and a third dimension of garlic.
