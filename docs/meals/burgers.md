## Ingredients

* [ ] Meat: Ground Beef, Ground Chuck (80/20), or Ground Beef Short Ribs
* [ ] Cast Iron Pan or Grill
* [ ] For the pan, use Beef Fat or cook Bacon first (don't use butter)
* [ ] Kaiser Roll / Potato Roll, plain toasted
* [ ] Lettuce/Tomato/Ketchup/Dill Pickles

## Recipe

* See notes section. Brief instructions below
* Work the meat into a patty until it sticks to your hand and won't fall off. Work to the diameter of the bun, but to a thickness of your thumb. Form into a volcano shape
* Season with salt. Set on pan and cook until browned. Add onion on top and flip. Cook until firm (medium-well). Add a slice of Munster and let partially melt. The cheese will continue to melt when removed

## Notes

* Volcano Shape: dimple an outer-circle so that the middle and outer edge are highest (this shape is best to allow the burger to expand while cooking)
* Cast Iron Pan: a pan with sides are better than a flat skillet for convective heat
* Season with salt right-before cooking to help dry out the burger and form the crust (keeps the juice inside)
* Munster cheese (melts like American, but has flavor)
