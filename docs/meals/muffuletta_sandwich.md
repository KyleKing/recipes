## Ingredients

### For the cream cheese

1 cup spicy olives, pitted
2/3 cup spicy pickled cherry peppers from a jar, stems removed
2/3 cup capers
1 pound cream cheese
2/3 cup crumbled feta
Kosher salt to taste

### For the sandwich

1/2 cup butter, room temperature
8 thick slices white bread
4 tablespoons Duke’s Mayo
8 thin slices mortadella
8 slices provolone cheese
20 thin slices soppressata
2 cups arugula
1/2 red onion, thinly sliced
1/2 cup pickled banana peppers

## Recipe

- For the cream cheese: In a food processor, pulse the spicy olives, cherry peppers, and capers until everything is finely chopped, but not pureed. Transfer the ingredients to a fine-mesh strainer and push them until you squeeze out any excess liquid.
- Pulse the cream cheese, feta, and a pinch of salt until smooth, about 1 minute. Add the rest of the ingredients back into the food processor with the feta cream cheese and pulse until fully incorporated. Muffuletta cream cheese can be made up to 2 weeks ahead of time and stored in the refrigerator. Leave out at room temperature around 30 minutes before using so it spreads more easily on sandwiches and bagels.
- For the sandwiches: Heat a nonstick or seasoned cast-iron pan over medium heat. Spread butter on both sides of the white bread slices. Toast them in the pan until golden brown on both sides. Set aside for 1 minute so they’re firm.
- Spread the mayonnaise evenly across the four bottom slices of bread. Add the mortadella, provolone, and soppressata slices, divided equally, onto the bottom bread slices. Pile on the arugula, red onions, and pickled banana peppers. Spread a liberal layer of muffuletta cream cheese on the top slices of bread and stack the slices on tops of the rest of the sandwiches. Don’t be afraid to go wild—the cream cheese is the key ingredient! Cut the sandwiches in half and serve.
