## Ingredients

- [ ] ¼ pound Swiss or Emmentaler cheese, thinly sliced
- [ ] 8 slices rye bread with caraway seeds
- [ ] ¼ cup butter
- [ ] 1 cup sauerkraut, squeezed of liquid
- [ ] 2 pounds smoked turkey, shaved thin
- [ ] ½ cup Russian dressing:
    - [ ] ½ cup mayonnaise
    - [ ] 2 tablespoons ketchup
    - [ ] 3 tablespoons finely chopped cornichons or dill pickles
    - [ ] 2 tablespoons chopped tarragon
    - [ ] Splash of Tabasco
    - [ ] Splash of Worcestershire
    - [ ] Salt
    - [ ] Pepper

## Recipe

- Mix together the Russian Dressing and season with salt and pepper
- Evenly divide the cheese between four slices of rye bread, then top with remaining rye bread slices. Melt half the butter in a large frying pan over medium-low heat. Add two of the cheese sandwiches. Brown the sandwiches for approximately 5 minutes on each side until they’re a crispy golden brown and the cheese has melted.
- Remove the sandwiches, add the rest of the butter to the pan, and brown the remaining two sandwiches as above.
- Open the sandwiches, divide the sauerkraut and turkey between them and place on top of the melted cheese. Spread the Russian dressing on one side of each. Close the sandwiches and serve immediately.

## Notes

- The dressing should be chunky like a salsa
