## Recipe

- Mix together the taco seasoning
- In a large pan on medium-high heat, combine the seasoned beef ingredients and crush into pebbles with a potato masher
    - Once browned and cooked through, turn the heat off
    - Stir in the beef broth to give it a softer texture. Taste and adjust as needed
    - Cover or set aside until ready to use
- Either use tostadas or spritz each corn tortilla with oil and crisp in a pan until golden brown and crunchy
- Grate the pepper jack cheese, dice and salt the tomatoes, shred the lettuce, and gather other components
- To assemble, first place a large flour tortilla in the pan with a handful of grated cheese in the center
    - Once the cheese has started to melt, remove it from the pan
    - Using the size of the corn tortilla as a guide, place a pile of seasoned beef in the center, then add a drizzle of sour cream, hot sauce, and lime juice
    - Place the crispy corn tortilla over the top of the beef. Spread more sour cream on the corn tortilla, then add the tomatoes, lettuce, and pickled onions
        - Be careful not to overfill it or it will be tough to fold
- For each, fold the flour tortilla towards the center in a circle around the corn tortilla
    - Place the folded side face down in the hot pan and crisp the bottom of the crunchwrap to seal, then flip and crisp the top until golden brown
- Cut in half and enjoy with extra sour cream and/or hot sauce
