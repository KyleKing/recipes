## Ingredients

### Noodles

- [ ] 8 oz dried stir-fry noodles (about 1/2 bag) such as thick stir-fry rice noodles, dragon noodles, etc.

### Stir Fry

- [ ] 1 Tbsp refined sesame oil, grape, or canola
- [ ] 1/2 large sweet onion, thinly sliced
- [ ] 2 large broccoli crowns (1.5 pounds total), cut into bite-size florets
- [ ] 1/2 large red bell pepper, seeded and thinly sliced
- [ ] 1 yellow bell pepper, seeded and thinly sliced
- [ ] 1/2 cup roasted, unsalted whole cashews

### Sauce

- [ ] 5 Tbsp low-sodium soy sauce
- [ ] 1/2 cup fresh orange juice (from 2 large oranges)
- [ ] 1 Tbsp cornstarch
- [ ] 1 tsp Sriracha

### Finishing

- [ ] 1/4 cup water
- [ ] 2 cloves garlic, thinly sliced
- [ ] 1.5 tsp ground ginger

## Recipe

- Chop the vegetables
- Start a pot for the noodles and cook in parallel following the package directions (drain when done)
- Add oil to a large skillet or saute pan over high heat. Add the onion and stir-fry for 2 minutes until starts to brown
- Add the red and yellow bell peppers, broccoli, cashews, and salt. Stir-fry for 5 minutes, or until the thickest broccoli stems are tender and the cashews are slightly blackened
- Reduce the heat to low. Add the water, stirring until it evaporates. This helps the pan to cool down. Add the garlic and ginger, then stir-fry for 1 last minute
- Whisk together the soy sauce, orange juice, cornstarch, and Sriracha in a medium bowl
- Turn off the heat. Add the soy sauce mixture, stirring until it thickens into a glossy sauce
- Add the drained noodles and stir gently until everything is evenly coated

## Notes

- Optional: Saute cubed chicken until it is golden brown, then stir in before serving
