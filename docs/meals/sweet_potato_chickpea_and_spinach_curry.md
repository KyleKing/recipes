## Recipe

- Prep the onions and sweet potatoes. Start the rice

- Saute the onions with the curry paste. Cook for 10m until soft and golden
- Finely chop the chili and then add the chili, ginger, coriander, sweet potato, chickpeas, tomatoes, and 200 ml water to the pan. Bring to a boil
    - Reduce the heat to a simmer, then cover and cook for 10-15 min

## Notes

- You could add chopped cauliflower, red pepper, or aubergine before the sweet potato; throw in shredded cooked chicken with the tomatoes; add raw prawns or white fish pieces 5 minutes before the end of the cooking time; or serve in a flatbread with grated carrot, coriander, and shredded lettuce
