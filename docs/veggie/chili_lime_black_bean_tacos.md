## Ingredients

* [ ] 4 scallions, trimmed and thinly sliced crosswise (white and green parts)
* [ ] 2 small red onion, thinly sliced
* [ ] 1/2 cup lime juice (from 2 or 3 limes)
* [ ] Kosher salt
* [ ] 4 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
* [ ] Two 15.5-ounce can no-salt-added black beans, with the liquid
* [ ] 2 tsp chili powder
* [ ] 2 tsp ground cumin
* [ ] 2 tsp Spanish smoked paprika (piment√≥n; sweet or hot)
* [ ] 2 tsp Dijon mustard
* [ ] 12 6-inch corn tortillas
* [ ] 2 cups chopped romaine lettuce (from 1 heart of romaine)
* [ ] Hot sauce, such as Cholula

## Recipe

* 1-Two-onion quick pickle: Combine scallions and half the red onion slices in a medium bowl (see source for optional steps to soak in hot water). Combine lime juice, rinsed red onions and scallions, and pinch of kosher salt in a small jar or liquid measuring cup. Let stand while you make the remainder of the recipe, or for at least 10 minutes
* 2-Black beans: Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the remaining red onion and cook without stirring for about 3 minutes (until lightly browned). Add black beans and liquid, chili powder, cumin, paprika, Dijon mustard, and 1/2 tsp of kosher salt; stir to incorporate. Cook for 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the liquid reduces to a thick sauce
* 3-Tortillas: Place tortilla on grate above gas burner. Char on medium heat for a few seconds per side. Alternatively, broil for 1 min on each side
* 4-Assemble: place some chopped romaine at the center of each tortilla, then add a large spoonful of the black bean mixture. Top with the pickled red onion and hot sauce. Optionally, pour a small splash of the juice from the pickling jar onto each taco

## Notes

* Scaled to 4x
* Could add pan-fried shrimp
* Refrigerate leftover black bean filling and pickled onion for up to 2 days. Reheat black beans on stove top
