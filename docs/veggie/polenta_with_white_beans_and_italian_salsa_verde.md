## Ingredients

* [ ] FOR THE POLENTA
    * [ ] 3 cups low-sodium vegetable broth
    * [ ] 3/4 cup medium-grind or stone-ground cornmeal
    * [ ] 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
    * [ ] 1 tablespoon unsalted butter
    * [ ] Freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, for garnish
* [ ] FOR THE BEANS AND GREENS
    * [ ] 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
    * [ ] One 15-ounce can low-sodium white beans, such as cannellini or Great Northern white beans, drained and rinsed
    * [ ] 2 medium cloves garlic, minced
    * [ ] Pinch crushed red pepper flakes
    * [ ] 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
    * [ ] Freshly ground black pepper
    * [ ] 1 cup (2 ounces) baby spinach leaves or other chopped, dark leafy greens
* [ ] FOR THE SALSA VERDE
    * [ ] 2 tablespoons minced fresh flat-leaf parsley
    * [ ] 1 tablespoon minced fresh oregano (may substitute more parsley here)
    * [ ] 1 tablespoon capers in brine, drained
    * [ ] 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
    * [ ] 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice

## Recipe

* For the creamy polenta: Bring the broth to a boil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the cornmeal gradually, whisking constantly, to form a thickened and smooth mixture. Add the salt and reduce the heat to low. Cook over low heat, slowly bubbling, for 20 minutes: The mixture will resemble a thick, yellow paste. Turn off the heat and stir in the butter until it has melted.
* Meanwhile, whip up those beans and greens: Heat the oil in a medium skillet over medium heat. Add the beans, garlic, crushed red pepper flakes, salt and a few grinds of black ground pepper. Cook for 5 to 7 minutes, until fragrant and warmed through (enjoy that perfume of wafting garlic). Stir in the spinach or other greens and continue cooking for 1 minute until that has wilted. Remove from the heat.
* Finally, make the salsa verde: Stir together the parsley, oregano, capers, oil and lemon juice in a medium bowl.
* Spoon the warm polenta into bowls. Top with the beans and greens, salsa verde and grated cheese. Serve warm.
