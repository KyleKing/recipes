## Ingredients

* [ ] 1/2 tsp kosher salt, plus more as needed
* [ ] 8 oz dried pasta shells (medium-size)
* [ ] 1/4 cup full-fat coconut milk (see Note) 
* [ ] 1 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
* [ ] 2/3 cup low-sodium vegetable broth, or more as needed
* [ ] 1½ tsp Dijon mustard
* [ ] 2 tbsp nutritional yeast
* [ ] 1 garlic clove, quartered
* [ ] 1/2 tsp onion powder
* [ ] 1/2 tsp Spanish smoked paprika (pimentón), plus more for garnish
* [ ] 6 oz (1½ cups) frozen cubed butternut squash
* [ ] 2 oz (1/3 cup) roasted, salted cashews
* [ ] One 4-oz can diced mild green chiles, drained
* [ ] Ground cumin, for garnish

## Recipe

* Boil pasta until al dente, according to package instructions, then drain
* While the pasta cooks, make the 'cheese' sauce: Whisk together coconut milk, oil, broth, Dijon mustard, nutritional yeast, garlic, onion powder, smoked paprika, and the 1/2 tsp of salt in a medium saucepan
* Add the frozen butternut squash and cashews. Cook over medium-low heat, barely bubbling at the edges, for 10 minutes
* Transfer the sauce ingredients to a blender, add 3 tbsp of the green chiles and puree to form a smooth, cheesy-looking sauce. (A high-powered blender such as a Vitamix makes quick work of it; if using a standard blender, you may need to add a splash more vegetable broth). Taste, and add more salt as needed
* Return the drained pasta to the pot, then stir in the sauce and the remaining green chiles
* Serve with a garnish of smoked paprika and cumin

## Notes

* Note: Thoroughly stir the coconut milk before using to re-incorporate its fat. You’ll use most of the remaining coconut milk from a 15-oz can in the Veggie-Loaded Red Curry
* Week 3
