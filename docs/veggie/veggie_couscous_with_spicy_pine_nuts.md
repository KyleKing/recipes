* Cook the onion until tender (7 min), then add the cinnamon, cumin, cayenne, and salt (1 min)

* *Meanwhile* start the couscous following the box directions
* Bring to a boil then reduce heat to a simmer and cook until the sweet potatoes are easily pierced with a fork (15-20 min)
* Serve the vegetables over the fluffed couscous. Season with salt and pepper, and drizzle with olive oil, and optionally garnish with cilantro
