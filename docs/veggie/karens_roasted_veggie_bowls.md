## Recipe

### Roasting

- Preheat oven to 400F. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper
- Prep your vegetables: chop broccoli into medium sized florets, de-stem and chop kale, scrub and slice sweet potato into 1/4” wide rounds
- Massage the broccoli florets with oil, garlic, salt, and pepper - make sure to work the ingredients into the tops of the florets. Lay them in a row down the center third of a large baking sheet
- Using the same bowl you mixed the broccoli in, combine chickpeas, oil, Sriracha and soy sauce. Spread them out in a row next to the broccoli
- In the same bowl combine the oil, curry powder, salt, and Sriracha. Add the sliced sweet potato and toss to coat. Lay the rounds on the remaining third of the baking tray
- Bake for 10 minutes. Flip the broccoli and sweet potatoes and redistribute the chickpeas to promote even cooking. Bake for another 8-12 minutes

### Quinoa

- Rinse and drain the quinoa. Add rinsed quinoa and broth/water to a small saucepan and bring to a boil over high heat. Turn the heat down to medium-low, cover and simmer for approx. 15 minutes
- Once cooked, fluff with a fork and set aside

### Kale

- While the quinoa is simmering, and the rest of the ingredients are roasting, preheat a large skillet with 1 tsp oil
- Add the kale and cook for approx. 5 minutes, or until nearly tender
- Add the salt, chili powder, and lime juice. Toss to coat and cook for another 2-3 minutes

### Serving

- Assemble the bowls: Scoop ½ - 1 cup of quinoa into each bowl, top with ½ of the broccoli, ½ the chickpeas, ½ kale, and ½ sweet potatoes
- Feel free to keep everything separated in the bowl or mix it all together
