## Ingredients

### Masala Spice Mix

- [ ] 2 Tbsp garam masala
- [ ] 1/2 tsp cumin
- [ ] 1/2 tsp turmeric
- [ ] 1/2 tsp smoked paprika
- [ ] 1/2 tsp salt
- [ ] 1/4 tsp cayenne
- [ ] Pepper

### Skillet Ingredients

- [ ] 1 yellow onion, finely diced
- [ ] 3 cloves garlic, minced
- [ ] 1/2 Tbsp grated fresh ginger, grate
- [ ] 2 Tbsp olive oil
- [ ] 12 oz frozen cauliflower florets
- [ ] 1 15 oz can chickpeas, drained
- [ ] 1 15 oz can tomato sauce
- [ ] 1/4 cup water
- [ ] 1/3 cup heavy cream
- [ ] salt to taste

## Recipe

- In a small bowl, combine the spices for the masala spice mix
- Prep the onion, garlic, and ginger. Add all three to a large skillet and saute in olive oil over medium heat until the onions are soft and translucent (about 3 minutes)
    - Add the spice mix and continue to saute for one more minute
- Add the frozen cauliflower florets to the skillet and continue to saute (~5 min)
- Add the drained chickpeas, tomato sauce, and 1/4 cup water to the skillet. Stir to combine, then allow them to simmer over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, for about 15 minutes
    - This will help mellow the acidity of the tomato sauce and allow the spices to blend. If the mixture becomes too dry as it simmers, add a couple more tablespoons of water
- After the sauce has simmered for 15 minutes, turn off the heat and stir in the heavy cream. Add a pinch of salt
- Serve in a bowl either over rice or with a piece of bread for dipping.
