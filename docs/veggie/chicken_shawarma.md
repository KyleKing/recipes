## Ingredients

- [ ] FOR THE CHICKEN
- [ ] FOR THE CABBAGE SALAD
- [ ] FOR ASSEMBLY

## Recipe

- Marinate the chicken: In a medium bowl, whisk together the olive oil, cumin, pepper, turmeric, salt, coriander, cardamom, paprika, garlic powder, oregano, cinnamon, cloves and ginger. Add the chicken thighs and toss to coat, ensuring the spice rub gets into all the folds and crevices of the thighs. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes and up to 12 hours.
- Make the cabbage salad: While the chicken marinates, in a large bowl, whisk together the olive oil, vinegar, salt, sugar and pepper. Add the cabbage and gently toss to coat. Cover and let sit for at least 30 minutes, or refrigerate for up to 24 hours.
- Cook the chicken: Heat a large, heavy skillet or grill pan over medium-high heat until almost smoking. Lightly brush the pan with a whisper of oil to coat. Cook the chicken until golden, with crispy edges, 5 to 6 minutes per side. Transfer to a cutting board, let rest for 1 to 2 minutes, then chop into bite-size pieces.
- Toast the pitas lightly and stuff them with the cabbage salad, chicken, cilantro and pickled onions, if using. Serve right away, with harissa and amba, if using, on the side.

## Notes

- To make pickled onions, follow the WaPo recipe here, but use apple cider vinegar in place of white: https://www.washingtonpost.com/recipes/quick-pickled-onions/17214/
- Ingredients:
- 1/2 cup water
- 1/2 cup distilled white vinegar (how much apple cider vinegar?)
- 2.5 tsp sugar
- 1 tsp fine sea salt
- 1 clove garlic, roughly chopped
- 1/2 tsp brown mustard seeds
- 1 medium red onion (about 5 ounces), halved and thinly sliced
- In a 2-cup glass jar with a lid, combine the water, vinegar, sugar and salt and stir until dissolved. Add the garlic and mustard seed, stir, then add the onion. Cover and gently tilt the jar back and forth to evenly distribute the ingredients. Refrigerate for 24 hours before using.
