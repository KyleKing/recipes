## Ingredients

* [ ] 2x 15-oz cans of black beans, drained and rinsed
* [ ] Generous 1 cup chickpea flour
* [ ] 3 tbsp tomato paste
* [ ] 2 tbsp plain, unsweetened applesauce
* [ ] 1 tsp chili powder
* [ ] 2 tsp tamari
* [ ] 2 tsp apple cider vinegar
* [ ] 2 tbsp fresh lime juice
* [ ] 1/2 tsp salt
* [ ] 1/2 tsp black pepper
* [ ] Vegetable oil, for shallow frying
* [ ] 8 whole wheat buns
* [ ] Toppings such as cheese, slices of tomato or onion, pickles, mustard and/or ketchup

## Recipe

* Use a fork to mash the beans in a large mixing bowl so they're mushy but not totally smooth. There should still be some whole beans in the mixture
* Add the chickpea flour, tomato paste, applesauce, chili powder, tamari, vinegar, lime juice, salt, and pepper, stirring to incorporate
* In a skillet, pour a thin layer of oil and heat on medium heat
* Place a generous 1/3 cup of the mixture in the center of the pan. Carefully press it into a round, pressing until the patty is about 3/4 inch thick. Repeat to form 2-4 burgers
* Cook until browned and crisp on both sides (1-2 min per side). Flip as needed so that they cook evenly
* Serve on buns, with cheese, slices of tomato and onion, pickles, mustard, and/or ketchup
