## Ingredients

* [ ] hummus
* [ ] siracha
* [ ] carrot, peeled with a vegetable peeler
* [ ] spinach, arugula, and/or baby kale
* [ ] 1/2 avocado
* [ ] cucumber (optional)
* [ ] roasted red pepper (optional)
* [ ] nori, pita, tortilla, or naan

## Recipe

* The original recipe uses nori, but wraps work too. Layer on the hummus, then top with ingredients

## Notes

* To make roasted red peppers, hold them over a burner with tongs until charred. Put in a glass bowl with lid to let them steam and to make remove the char easier. Source: https://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-roast-peppers-3-ways-234734
* Other vegetables worth trying: red cabbage, radish, asparagus spears, zucchini, or sprouts
