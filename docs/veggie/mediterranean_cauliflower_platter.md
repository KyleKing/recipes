## Recipe

* There are a few components to prepare for this platter, so we’ll be multitasking! Start with the cauliflower and preheat the oven to 450 degrees. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. 
* Toss together the cauliflower, oil, thyme, cumin, turmeric, lemon zest and salt in a mixing bowl until evenly coated, then spread in a single layer on the baking sheet. Roast until fork-tender, about 25 minutes. 
* While that’s roasting, get that quinoa salad cooking: Combine the quinoa, salt and water in a medium saucepan. Bring it to a boil, then cover and cook, gently bubbling, for 13 to 17 minutes, until the water is absorbed and the quinoa is fluffy. Remove from the heat and let stand, covered, for 5 minutes. (If making ahead, refrigerate until serving.)
* If you’re making the quinoa salad right away, here’s a trick for bringing that steaming hot quinoa to room temperature quickly: Spread it in an even layer on a baking sheet for about 3 minutes. Now, transfer the quinoa to a medium bowl and mix it with the parsley, cherry tomatoes, red bell pepper, lemon juice, oil and black pepper. Taste, and add more salt as needed. The salt should perfectly balance the pop of the lemon!
* Finally, let’s make those warmed olives. Combine the oil and garlic in a small skillet over medium-low heat. Cook for 1 minute, then add the olives and cook for 5 minutes until warmed through, stirring occasionally. Remove from the heat. Add the thyme, crushing it with your fingers as you sprinkle it over the olives. (You can skip this and go with straight-up olives in a pinch, but it adds great flavor with minimal effort.)
* Channel your inner Matisse and arrange the roasted cauliflower, quinoa salad, olives, hummus, cucumber slices, almonds and pita wedges on a platter. Garnish the hummus with paprika, if desired

## Notes

* Roast the cauliflower in advance and reheat it in a 400-degree oven until warmed through just before serving. Cook the quinoa in advance and store it refrigerated; bring to room temperature and mix it together with the remaining ingredients just before serving
* Want to add extra protein? Carve out a spot (or add side plate) for prosciutto and/or a variety of cheeses
