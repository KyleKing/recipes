## Ingredients

### Toasts

* [ ] One 15.5-ounce can no-salt-added chickpeas, drained
* [ ] 1 celery rib, finely chopped
* [ ] 2 scallions, trimmed and thinly sliced (white and green parts)
* [ ] 2 tablespoons capers in brine, drained
* [ ] 1 tablespoon mayonnaise
* [ ] 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
* [ ] 2 teaspoons white wine vinegar
* [ ] 1/2 teaspoon Spanish smoked paprika (pimentón), plus more for garnish
* [ ] 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
* [ ] 4 slices artisan-style bread, toasted

### Eggs

* [ ] 1 teaspoon white wine vinegar
* [ ] 4 large eggs

## Recipe

* *Chickpea salad*: Place the chickpeas in a medium bowl and smash with a potato masher or fork until most of them are broken down. Add the celery, scallions, capers, mayonnaise, Dijon mustard, white wine vinegar, smoked paprika, and salt. Stir gently to incorporate
* *Eggs*: Pour at least 2 inches of water into a large skillet. Stir in the white wine vinegar and heat over medium-high heat until the water is at a low simmer, just before bubbles start to rise off the bottom of the pan
    * Crack one egg into a small bowl and use the bowl to gently slide the egg into the water. Repeat for the remaining eggs. Don’t worry if the egg whites spread out a bit as you add them. Cook without stirring for 4 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the eggs to a plate and cover loosely to keep warm
* *Serve*: spread equal amounts of the chickpea salad on the toasted bread slices, then top with poached eggs. Sprinkle a little smoked paprika on each egg (eat with a knife and fork)
