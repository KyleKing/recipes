## Ingredients

* [ ] 4 oz dried stir-fry noodles of your choice (we used thick stir-fry rice noodles)
* [ ] 1/4 cup low-sodium soy sauce
* [ ] 1/2 cup fresh orange juice (from 2 large oranges)
* [ ] 2 tbsp cornstarch
* [ ] 1 tsp Sriracha
* [ ] 1 tablespoon dark miso
* [ ] 1 tablespoon pure sesame oil (may substitute a neutral oil such as grape seed or canola)
* [ ] 1/2 large sweet onion, thinly sliced
* [ ] 1/2 large red bell pepper, seeded and thinly sliced
* [ ] 1 yellow bell pepper, seeded and thinly sliced
* [ ] 2 large broccoli crowns (1.5 pounds total), cut into bite-size florets
* [ ] 1/2 cup roasted, unsalted whole cashews
* [ ] 2 pinches kosher salt
* [ ] 1/4 cup water
* [ ] 2 cloves garlic, thinly sliced
* [ ] One-inch piece peeled fresh ginger root, minced or grated (about 1 1/2 tsp)

## Recipe

* Cook the noodles as directed on the package, then drain
* Meanwhile, whisk together the soy sauce, orange juice, cornstarch, Sriracha, and miso in a medium bowl
* Add oil to a large skillet or saute pan over high heat. Add the onion and stir-fry for 2 minutes until starts to brown
* Add the red and yellow bell peppers, broccoli, cashews, and salt. Stir-fry for 5 minutes, or until the thickest broccoli stems are tender and the cashews are slightly blackened
* Reduce the heat to low. Add the water, stirring until it evaporates. This helps the pan to cool down. Add the garlic and ginger, then stir-fry for 1 minute
* Turn off the heat. Add the soy sauce mixture, stirring until it thickens into a beautiful, glossy sauce. Add the drained noodles and stir gently until everything is evenly coated. Serve warm

## Notes

* Optional: Saute cubed chicken until itâ€™s golden brown, then stir in before serving
