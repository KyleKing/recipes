## Ingredients

* [ ] smoked salmon
* [ ] sushi rice
* [ ] nori

## Recipe

* Slice salmon into pieces to cover the sushi rice. Will look best with the fat lines running diagonally when wrapped
* Using two index fingers and your thumb shape a bite size clump of sushi rice
* Optionally add a bit of wasabi underneath the salmon
* Using your second hand's thumb and index finger, wrap the salmon over the rice

## Notes

* Look for smoked salmon with the most visible white fat lines
