- [ ] 100 g water (2 parts)
- [ ] 50 g rice vinegar (1 part)
- [ ] 50 g white vinegar (1 part)

## Recipe

- Prepare the sushi rice according to package directions and let cool
- While rice is cooking, prepare the pickled vegetables:
    - Combine water, rice vinegar, white vinegar, salt, and MSG in a bowl
    - Add julienned carrots and sliced serrano peppers
    - Let marinate for at least 15 minutes
- Cook edamame according to package directions and season with salt
- Prepare salmon:
    - If using raw salmon for sashimi, ensure it is sushi-grade and thinly slice
    - Alternatively, pan-sear or bake salmon and let cool
- Assemble the temaki (hand rolls):
    - Place a sheet of nori on your palm, shiny side down
    - Add a small amount of rice to the left third of the nori
    - Top with salmon, pickled vegetables, and a drizzle of kewpie mayo and sriracha
    - Roll from the bottom left corner to form a cone shape
- Garnish with black sesame seeds
- Serve with edamame on the side

## Notes

- Temaki are best eaten immediately after rolling to keep the nori crispy
- For a complete bento box, add other components like cucumber slices, avocado, or Japanese pickles
