## Ingredients



## Recipe

* Lay out a bamboo rolling mat, cutting board, knife, and small bowl of water
* Either place a sheet of plastic wrap down or put a bag over the bamboo rolling mat to make it easier to clean
* Place the nori shiny side down
* Dampen your fingers to prevent sticking, then spread the rice into a thin layer (don't press down to firmly). Leave ~1/2 inch exposed nori at the end
* > Maki Rolls
* Add the ingredients on top of the rice in lengthwise
* Dampen the exposed nori, then roll keeping the ingredients in place with your index fingers. The nori should stick to itself at the end
* > Uramaki (Inside Out Roll)
* Flip the nori and rice over, then add the ingredients in lengthwise
* By hand start rolling with the side out. When done, use the bamboo mat to give the roll its shape
* Press the roll while vertical, rotate 90' press again, then roll back to the original position to press one last time
* > Both
* Cut in half three times for a total of 8 rolls. Wet a knife to make the cuts easier and use a sawing motion
* Serve with wasabi and pickled ginger
