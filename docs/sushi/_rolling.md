## Recipe

### Shared Prep

- Lay out a bamboo rolling mat, cutting board, knife, and small bowl of water
- Either place a sheet of plastic wrap down or put a bag over the bamboo rolling mat to make it easier to clean
- Place the nori shiny side down
- Dampen your fingers to prevent sticking, then spread the rice into a thin layer (don't press down to firmly). Leave ~1/2 inch exposed nori at the end

### Maki Rolls

- Add the ingredients on top of the rice in lengthwise
- Dampen the exposed nori, then roll keeping the ingredients in place with your index fingers. The nori should stick to itself at the end

### Uramaki (Inside Out Roll)

> Based on [https://youtu.be/hfNhqawvSr8?t=2m50s](https://youtu.be/hfNhqawvSr8?t=2m50s)

- Flip the nori and rice over, then add the ingredients in lengthwise
- By hand start rolling with the side out. When done, use the bamboo mat to give the roll its shape
- Press the roll while vertical, rotate 90' press again, then roll back to the original position to press one last time

### Both

- Cut in half three times for a total of 8 rolls. Wet a knife to make the cuts easier and use a sawing motion
- Serve with wasabi and pickled ginger
