## Recipe

- Boil water and cook the noodles according to the package directions
- Garlic Lime Sauce
    - Mix the 1 tbsp water with the cornstarch. Mix it into a slurry and set aside
    - In the same saucepan, bring *most of* the sauce ingredients to a boil on medium heat (garlic, lime juice, brown sugar, water, fish sauce) until the sugar is dissolved
    - Whisk in the cornstarch slurry and the chili peppers
    - Cook for another 2 more minutes until a thick, sauce-like consistency. Season with extra salt or fish sauce if needed
    - Add one half of the garlic lime sauce to the shrimp and toss to combine. Set aside the rest of the sauce
- Plate the lettuce, noodles, cucumber, carrots, cilantro, and shrimp. Sprinkle with spring onions and chopped peanuts. Drizzle with the remaining sauce

## Notes

- If you can't find Thai Chiles, you can substitute them with Serrano peppers or *diced* jalapenos along with a tsp of Red Pepper Flakes, Cayenne, or Hot Paprika to restore some of the heat
