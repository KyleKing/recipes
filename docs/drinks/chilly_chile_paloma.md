## Ingredients

* [ ] 2 oz (1/4 cup) fresh ruby red grapefruit juice
* [ ] 1/2 oz fresh lime juice
* [ ] 1 1/2 oz blanco tequila, such as 1800 Silver
* [ ] 1/2 oz Royal Rose Three Chile Simple Syrup (see headnote)
* [ ] Pinch kosher salt
* [ ] 1 cup crushed or chipped ice
* [ ] Wedge of lime, for garnish

## Recipe

* Pour the juice into at least 2 wells of a standard ice cube tray. Freeze until solid
* To make sure the right amount of ice is used, combine the following ingredients in a 2-cup-capacity liquid measuring cup: lime juice, tequila, chile simple syrup, salt, grapefruit ice cubes and enough crushed or chipped ice to total a scant 1 1/2 cups
* Transfer to a blender. Puree on the highest speed for 20 seconds, then stop to stir with a cocktail spoon. Blend again to eliminate any remaining chunks of ice
* Serve in a chilled rocks or coupe glass, garnished with the lime wedge

## Notes

* This frozen version of the Paloma brings in grapefruit juice instead of the traditional grapefruit soda and substitutes a mild chili-infused simple syrup for agave nectar.
* You’ll want to freeze the grapefruit juice cubes the night before: 1 oz of juice fits in a single well of a standard ice cube tray. We found Royal Rose’s Three Chile Simple Syrup in the District, at Ace Beverage and Salt & Sundry in Union Market
* Make Ahead: The grapefruit juice needs to be frozen for a few hours or up to a day in advance
