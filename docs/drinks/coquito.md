## Ingredients

- [ ] 12 oz canned evaporated milk
- [ ] 14 oz canned, sweetened condensed milk
- [ ] 15 oz canned cream of coconut, such as Coco Lopez brand (see headnote)
- [ ] 14 oz canned, full-fat coconut milk
- [ ] 2 cups white rum, such as Don Q or Bacardi
- [ ] 1 cup gold rum, such as Don Q or Bacardi Gold
- [ ] 1 tbsp vanilla extract or vanilla paste
- [ ] 1 tsp ground cinnamon
- [ ] Freshly grated nutmeg, for serving
- [ ] 3-inch cinnamon sticks, for garnish (optional)

## Recipe

- Working in batches, combine the evaporated milk, condensed milk, cream of coconut and coconut milk in a blender; puree until smooth, pouring the blended mixture into a large mixing bowl as you go. Blend the rums, vanilla extract or paste and the ground cinnamon with some of the coconut mixture, then whisk all of the liquids together in the bowl.
- Pour into a pitcher or glass bottles and jars with lids (with the aid of a funnel, if you have one). Seal and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or until very cold
- Before serving, stir or shake well to break up any solids. (If you find any remaining solids unpleasant, simply strain the coquito through a fine-mesh strainer)
- Pour into small glasses; garnish each portion with a sprinkling of freshly grated nutmeg and a cinnamon stick, if desired

## Notes

- This makes a lot. Extra could be used for baked French toast, bread pudding, or frozen
