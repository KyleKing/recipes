## Ingredients

* [ ] 1/2 cup vanilla ice cream
* [ ] 2 cups ice cubes
* [ ] 4 oz chilled coffee
* [ ] 2 oz brandy
* [ ] 2 oz coffee liqueur, such as Tia Maria
* [ ] 1/4 teaspoon coffee grounds, for garnish (optional)

## Recipe

* Combine the ice cream, ice cubes, coffee, brandy and coffee liqueur in a blender. Puree on HIGH until the ice is completely broken down and the mixture is the consistency of a milkshake
* Divide between two highball glasses, then sprinkle a pinch of coffee grounds, if using, over the top of each. Reserve any leftovers for topping off

## Notes

* TODO: Need to revisit
* The classic Irish coffee is pumped up with whiskey and served hot to warm up cold Gaelic afternoons
* At the Erin Rose bar in New Orleans’s French Quarter, the drink has been adapted for the climate. While the recipe is a house secret, the bar provided a few pointers — one of which is that their version is made with brandy instead of Irish whiskey. Make and chill the coffee ahead of time
* You’ll need a blender; you may wish to serve the drinks with straws
