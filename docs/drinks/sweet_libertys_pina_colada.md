## Ingredients

* [ ] 1 1/2 cups crushed ice
* [ ] 1 1/2 oz aged rum (may substitute rum blend of your choice; see headnote)
* [ ] Two 1-inch fresh pineapple chunks
* [ ] 1 1/2 oz pineapple juice
* [ ] 3 oz cream of coconut (see headnote)
* [ ] 5 coffee beans
* [ ] 1 oz Pedro Ximenez sherry
* [ ] Mint sprig, for garnish (optional)
* [ ] Fresh cherry, for garnish (optional)

## Recipe

* Chill a tall glass
* Combine the ice, rum, pineapple chunks and juice, cream of coconut and coffee beans in a blender; puree until smooth
* Pour into the chilled glass; pour the sherry on top. Garnish with the mint sprig and/or cherry, if using

## Notes

* Status: WIP
* This frozen cocktail contains two delightful surprises: a float of sweet sherry, and coffee beans that go surprisingly well with the classic flavors.
* At Sweet Liberty Drinks & Supply Company, a house blend of spiced, coconut and aged rums is used; you can do the same or keep it simple with an aged rum. The bar makes its own coconut cream; Coco Lopez cream of coconut works well here.
