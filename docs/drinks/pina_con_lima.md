## Ingredients

* [ ] 3 to 4 oz fresh pineapple, plus a small slice or wedge for garnish
* [ ] 1 1/2 oz light rum (may substitute a combination of light and gold rums)
* [ ] 3/4 oz cream of coconut
* [ ] 3/4 oz fresh lime juice, plus 1/4 teaspoon finely grated lime zest
* [ ] 1 cup crushed ice

## Recipe

* In the following order, combine these ingredients in a blender: the pineapple (to taste), rum, cream of coconut, lime juice and ice. Blend on the highest speed for 30 seconds, then pour into a highball glass
* Garnish with the pineapple slice or wedge and a sprinkling of lime zest. Serve right away

## Notes

* Status: WIP
* The classic pina colada recipe results in a frothy, boozy, intensely sweet shake. This variation keeps the drink’s heart of pineapple and coconut but balances the sweetness with fresh lime juice
* You’ll need a blender
* Where to Buy: Cream of coconut is available at most grocery stores. Look for pineapple with a rich, sweet smell (or, if picking the pre-cut kind, look for fruit that’s intensely yellow)
