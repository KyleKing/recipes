## Ingredients

### Classic

- [ ] 3/4 oz Cognac
- [ ] 3/4 oz rum
- [ ] 3/4 oz Cointreau
- [ ] 3/4 oz fresh lemon juice

### Ideal

- [ ] 1 oz Paul Beau VS Cognac
- [ ] 1 oz Appleton Estate Reserve Blend Rum
- [ ] 3/4 oz Pierre Ferrand dry curacao
- [ ] 3/4 oz fresh lemon juice
- [ ] 1 tsp Demerara Gum Syrup (Note: instructions in Cocktail Codex require an immersion circulator - need to find an alternative or try with Cointreau as mentioned in the below note)

## Recipe

- Shake all ingredients with ice, then strain into a chilled coupe

## Notes

- Source: Cocktail Codex - SideCar Variant
- Look for balance with a flavorful Rum and weaker Cognac
- For the Ideal, if using Cointreau in place of the Pierre Ferrand, may be able to get by without the extra sweetener
