## Ingredients

* [ ] Classic
    * [ ] 3/4 oz Cognac
    * [ ] 3/4 oz rum
    * [ ] 3/4 oz Cointreau
    * [ ] 3/4 oz fresh lemon juice
* [ ] Ideal
    * [ ] 1 oz Paul Beau VS Cognac
    * [ ] 1 oz Appleton Estate Reserve Blend Rum
    * [ ] 3/4 oz Pierre Ferrand dry curacao
    * [ ] 3/4 oz fresh lemon juice
    * [ ] 1 tsp Demerara Gum Syrup (Note: instructions in Cocktail Codex require an immersion circulator - need to find an alternative or try with Cointreau as mentioned in the below note)

## Recipe

* Shake all ingredients with ice, then strain into a chilled coupe

## Notes

* Source: Cocktail Codex - SideCar Variant
* Look for balance with a flavorful Rum and weaker Cognac
* For the Ideal, if using Cointreau in place of the Pierre Ferrand, may be able to get by without the extra sweetener
