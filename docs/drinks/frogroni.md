## Ingredients

* [ ] 3 strawberries
* [ ] 1 cup crushed ice
* [ ] 3/4 oz Campari
* [ ] 2 oz gin
* [ ] 3/4 oz sweet vermouth
* [ ] 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice (from 1 or 2 lemons)
* [ ] 1.25 oz simple syrup (see NOTE)
* [ ] Twist of orange peel, for garnish

## Recipe

* Chill a tall glass
* Wash and hull two of the strawberries. Place in a blender, along with the ice, Campari, gin, vermouth, lemon juice and simple syrup; puree until smooth. Pour into the chilled glass; garnish with the remaining strawberry and the twist of orange peel
* NOTE: To make simple syrup, combine 1 cup of sugar and 1 cup of water in a small saucepan over medium heat, stirring until the sugar dissolves. Bring to a low boil, then cool. Transfer to a heatproof container. Once it has cooled to room temperature, cover tightly and refrigerate until chilled through; store indefinitely

## Notes

* TODO: Need to revisit
* Bartender Julie Reiner’s summery deep-freeze adjusts the classic Negroni recipe and adds strawberries — which go beautifully with Campari — and the brightness of lemon.
