<!-- TODO: Capture image for Bourbon Peach Shakes -->

## Ingredients

* [ ] 3/4 cup crushed ice, plus ice cubes for serving
* [ ] 3 oz bourbon
* [ ] 1 1/2 cups peach ice cream
* [ ] 8 oz chopped, peeled ripe peaches (from 2 to 3 peaches; see headnote)
* [ ] 4 dashes peach bitters
* [ ] Pinch salt
* [ ] Mint sprigs, for garnish (optional)

## Recipe

* Chill two rocks glasses.
* Combine the crushed ice, bourbon, ice cream, fruit, bitters and salt in a blender. Blend on high speed, until smooth and creamy.
* Add several ice cubes to each rocks glass, then pour the peach shake over each portion of ice.
* Garnish each drink with a sprig of mint, if desired.
* NOTE: To peel peaches, score their bottoms with a shallow 'X' and drop into boiling water for a few minutes. Drain; when cool enough to handle, discard the skins, which should slip off easily

## Notes

* Status: WIP
* Bourbon and peaches have a natural harmony; when you swirl them up with ice cream, they morph into a perfect treat for a hot summer afternoon
* You'll need fragrant, ripe fruit for this recipe — better to substitute with great nectarines rather than opt for mediocre peaches. We used Breyer’s peach ice cream, but if you can’t find it, you can use a good vanilla ice cream instead and augment the peach flavor by adding a few more ounces of peaches or a splash of peach liqueur such as Mathilde Peche
