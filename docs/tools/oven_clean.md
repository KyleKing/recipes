## Notes

* [ ] Baking soda
* [ ] Water
* [ ] Rubber gloves
* [ ] Damp dish cloth
* [ ] Plastic or silicone spatula
* [ ] Spray bottle
* [ ] White vinegar

* Empty the oven and make a baking soda paste
    * In a small bowl, mix 1/2 cup of baking soda with ~3 tbsp of water. Adjust the ratio of both as needed until you have a spreadable paste
* Spread the paste all over the interior surfaces of your oven, steering clear of the heating elements. Let it sit overnight
* Meanwhile, clean the oven racks. The guide has instructions on soaking in the bath tub, but we were able to carefully clean with some dish soap and rags
* Wipe out the oven with a damp dish cloth. Rinse and dry
* Spray a little vinegar where there is any remaining baking soda and wipe up the remaining residue until clean
