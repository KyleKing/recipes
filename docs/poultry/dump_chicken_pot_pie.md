## Ingredients

### Poached Chicken

- [ ] 4 boneless, skinless chicken thighs (1.5 - 2 lbs)
- [ ] Salt to taste
- [ ] 2 bay leaves

### Pot Pie

- [ ] Shredded Chicken, cooked (above)
- [ ] Bag of frozen peas
- [ ] 4-medium carrots, coined
- [ ] 1 10.5 oz can of *condensed* cream of chicken soup
- [ ] 1 10.5 oz can of *condensed* cream of mushroom soup
- [ ] 1x 8" tube of Crescent Roll Dough

## Recipe

### Poached Chicken

- Fill a pot with water
- Place over medium-low heat and add salt and bay leaves, while cool taste test for sufficient salt
- Bring the water to 160 F to 180 F, just below a simmer
- Add the chicken thighs and cook until the internal temp is 165 F (155 F if using breasts), about 15 minutes
- Let cool and shred. Can be stored in the fridge for 5 days and used in a variety of meals beyond the pot pie

### Pot Pie

- Arrange a rack in the middle of the oven and heat the oven to 375F
- In a 9x13 baking dish, add the shredded chicken, peas, carrots, and both cans of soup (reserve 1 tbsp of either)
- Gently stir to combine and spread into an even layer
- Carefully unroll 1 tube of crescent roll dough and lay over the filling (note: the dough doesn't need to reach the edges of the dish). Rub the reserved cream soup over the dough
- Bake until golden-brown and bubbling, about 30 min
    - If the dough has browned, but the filling isn't warmed, tent with aluminum foil
- Let cool for 5 to 10 minutes before serving

## Notes

- For poaching, any cut of chicken can be used. Additionally, the poaching liquid can be stock, spices, or any number of aromatics.
