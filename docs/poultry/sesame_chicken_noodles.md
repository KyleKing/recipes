### Dressing

* [ ] 1 tsp sesame oil

## Recipe

* Fill a large pot 2/3 full of water and bring to a boil. Add the chicken breast and remove from heat. Cover and let chicken sit until tender (15 minutes); check for done-ness and when done remove and place onto a plate
* With the same water, bring it back to a boil. Add the fettuccine and cook according to directions.
* In a medium bowl, which together the sauce until smooth.
* Rinse the noodles until cool, then pat dry. Toss the noodles with the remaining 1 tsp sesame oil. Shred the chicken by hand and toss with the noodles. Finally coat with the dressing

## Notes

* WARN: The chili oil and the vinegar were way too strong, so I ditched the dressing and went with pesto. Not sure what changes I would make
