## Ingredients

* [ ] 1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil
* [ ] 3 tbsp fresh rosemary, chopped (or 1 tbsp ground)
* [ ] 2 tbsp fresh sage, finely chopped (or 2 tsp ground)
* [ ] 1.5 tbsp red pepper flakes
* [ ] 4 chicken thighs
* [ ] 1/2 tsp pepper
* [ ] 1/4 tsp salt
* [ ] 2 lemons, zest
* [ ] 2 lemons, quartered
* [ ] 1 tbsp sunflower oil/high-heat oil (if needed)
* [ ] 2 bricks, double wrapped in tin foil
* [ ] cast iron skillet

## Recipe

* In a large bowl, combine everything except for the canola oil and quartered lemons. Pat the chicken dry then rub with the marinade. Refrigerate for 2-24 hours.
* Heat a large cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. Add the canola oil, the chicken (skin-side down), and then weigh down with the bricks.
* Cook for 7 minutes. Remove the bricks and flip the chicken. Cook for 7-9 minutes. Check that the chicken is fully cooked by piercing the thickest part with a knife and verify that none of the juices are pink.
* Remove the chicken, then sear the quartered lemons for 2 minutes on each side in the hot pan.
