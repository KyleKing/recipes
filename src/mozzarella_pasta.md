## Pasta + Mozzarella

- Box of pasta
- Bag of Frozen peas
- Pesto
- Red pepper flakes
- Mozzarella ball
- 1 Tomato

1. Boil the pasta following the directions, then for the last two minutes, add the frozen vegetable to the boiling pasta
2. Drain and return to the pot - immediately mix with pesto and red pepper flakes and wait to slightly cool
3. Serve the pasta and top with the diced tomato and mozzarella!

Note: if the mozzarella is added to hot pasta it will melt and get stringy, so store it separately, which will make reheating the pasta easier
