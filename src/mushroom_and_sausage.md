1. In a large pot, cook the sausages in a small amount of olive oil on medium heat until brown on the outside and firm {~5 minutes} (if precooked just skip this step)
2. Dice and prep the garlic, onions, and mushrooms. In parallel turn the heat off on the browning sausage to let cool
3. Using tongs, remove and slice the sausage into rounds. Toss the rounds back in for 4 minutes or until brown
4. Add the canned tomatoes, basil, oregano, garlic, onions, and mushrooms, then 3.5 cups of water and the box of pasta
5. With a lid, bring the pot to a rapid boil. Once boiling, stir, replace the lid, and simmer (~30%)
6. Stir the pot every five minutes while simmering. After 15 minutes if too much water is left, remove the lid and let simmer for slightly longer
