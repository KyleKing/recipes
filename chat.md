---

### Ingredients (4–6 servings)

**Protein**

* 1½–2 lb beef chuck *or* top sirloin, trimmed and cut into 1½-inch chunks
  *(Chuck = richer; sirloin = leaner)*

* 3 cloves garlic, minced
* 3 carrots, cut into chunks
* 2 celery stalks, sliced
* 1 lb baby potatoes, halved *(or see substitutions below)*
* 1 cup mushrooms, quartered (optional but great for umami)

**Liquids**

* 1 tbsp tomato paste

**Flavor**

### Method (Instant Pot)

1. **Sauté – build flavor**

   * Set Instant Pot to *Sauté (High)*.
   * Add oil and brown beef in batches (don’t crowd).
   * Remove beef and set aside.

2. **Aromatics**

   * Add onion, carrot, celery, mushrooms.
   * Cook 4–5 minutes until lightly softened.
   * Add garlic and tomato paste; cook 30 seconds.

3. **Deglaze**

   * Splash in a bit of broth and scrape the bottom well (important).

4. **Pressure cook**

   * Return beef to pot.
   * Add remaining broth, seasonings, Worcestershire, bay leaf.
   * Lock lid. Cook **35 minutes on High Pressure**.
   * Natural release 10 minutes, then quick release.

5. **Finish**

   * Taste and adjust salt/acid (a splash of vinegar or lemon brightens it).
   * Remove bay leaf.

## Making It Healthier (Without Losing Comfort)

### 1. Smarter Starch Choices

Instead of all potatoes:

* **Half potatoes + half turnips or rutabaga**
* **Sweet potatoes** (lower glycemic load + more nutrients)
* **White beans or chickpeas** (fiber + protein boost)

### 2. Thickening Without Flour or Butter

* Mash a few potatoes directly in the pot
* Blend ½ cup of stew liquid + veg and stir back in
* Add 1 tbsp chia seeds or ground flax (neutral flavor, high fiber)

### 3. Leaner Protein Options

* **Top sirloin or round** (lean, faster cook)
* **Bison** (very lean, great flavor)
* **Lamb leg** trimmed (richer but still cleaner than chuck)

### 4. Extra Vegetable Boost (Chef-Friendly)

Add after pressure cooking and simmer on sauté:

* Kale, chard, or spinach
* Frozen peas or green beans
* Zucchini or fennel for brightness

## Flavor Upgrades (Low-Calorie, High Impact)

* 1 anchovy melted into the onions
* Parmesan rind during cooking (remove at end)
* Splash of sherry vinegar or red wine vinegar
* Fresh herbs at the end (parsley + thyme)

---

## Make-Ahead & Storage

* Tastes better day 2–3
* Freezes extremely well
* Skim fat after chilling for an even leaner result
