## Recipe

1. Set the tofu on one of its large flat sides and cut it in half horizontally. Pat dry and wrap in towels. If time allows, press the tofu by placing a cast-iron skillet or other heavy object on top of the wrapped tofu for about 30 minutes.
1. Choose your sauce variation and mix all sauce ingredients together in a small bowl. Set aside. **Note:** For Veggie Western sauce, keep vegetables separate. For Classic Diner sauce, keep eggs separate.
1. Unwrap the tofu and season all sides with salt and pepper. Heat the oil in a medium skillet over medium-high. Add the tofu and cook until golden brown and crisp, 3 to 6 minutes per side.
1. **For Veggie Western only:** Remove tofu temporarily. Add diced bell peppers and onions to the pan, cook 3-4 minutes until softened. Add garlic and tomatoes, cook 1 minute more. Return tofu to pan.
1. Reduce heat to medium. Using a spatula or wooden spoon, break up the tofu into chunks. Add your prepared sauce and cook, stirring and continuing to break up the tofu, until the sauce is absorbed and the tofu is golden brown, 2 to 4 minutes.
1. **For Classic Diner only:** Push tofu to sides of pan, add beaten eggs to center, scramble until just set, then fold together with tofu.
1. Taste and adjust seasoning.

## Notes

- Add quick-cooking vegetables (spinach, kale, bell peppers, green onions) along with the sauce. Increase seasoning if adding vegetables.
