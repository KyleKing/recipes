## Ingredients

- [ ] 1 Part Frozen Base
- [ ] 1 Part Liquid Base
- [ ] 1/2 Part Flavor Adjuster
- [ ] Up to 1/3 Part Supporting Flavors

## Recipe

- Start slow, pulse, tamp, and work your way to a fast setting, then let it go for a solid 20-60 seconds

## Notes

### Specific Ingredients

**Frozen Base Options**

- Frozen banana (adds creaminess)
- Frozen mango, pineapple, or berries
- Frozen spinach or kale (iron-rich, mild flavor)

**Liquid Base Options**

- Almond milk, oat milk, or dairy milk
- Coconut water
- Orange juice (vitamin C enhances iron absorption)

**Flavor Adjusters**

- Room temperature banana
- Greek yogurt or kefir (protein, probiotics)
- Nut butter (peanut, almond, cashew)
- Dates or maple syrup (natural sweetness, iron)

**Supporting Flavors**

- Fresh spinach or kale (iron-rich)
- Chia seeds, hemp seeds, or pumpkin seeds (iron, omega-3)
- Cocoa powder or cacao nibs (iron, antioxidants)
- Fresh ginger or turmeric (anti-inflammatory)
- Spirulina or chlorella powder (iron, protein)
- Ground flaxseed (fiber, omega-3)

## Tips

- Smoothie shops often use frozen banana and almond milk as a base
- I have had success with 1/2 part liquid and 1/2 part yogurt instead of all liquid
- The 1/2 part flavor adjuster can also just be a room temperature banana if using flavorful bases
- Don't use ice because you'll end up with shards, less flavor, and the smoothie will melt more quickly

### Healthy Guidance

- Pair iron-rich ingredients with vitamin C sources (citrus, berries, kiwi, mango) to enhance absorption, but don't pair with tea or coffee
- Add protein (Greek yogurt, hemp seeds) and healthy fats (avocado, seeds) for nutrients and sustained energy
- Leafy greens provide iron, folate, and fiber without adding many calories
