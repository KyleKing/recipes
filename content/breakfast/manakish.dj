## Ingredients

### Flatbread Dough (Makes 6-8 flatbreads)

- [ ] 2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast (1 packet)
- [ ] 1 1/4 cups warm water (110°F)
- [ ] 1 teaspoon sugar
- [ ] 3 cups all-purpose flour
- [ ] 1/2 teaspoon salt
- [ ] 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil

### Za'atar Topping

- [ ] 1/3 cup za'atar spice blend
- [ ] 1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil

### For Serving (Lebanese Breakfast/Brunch Spread)

- [ ] 1 cup labneh or Greek yogurt
- [ ] Fresh mint leaves
- [ ] 2 medium tomatoes, sliced
- [ ] 1 cucumber, sliced
- [ ] 1 cup Kalamata olives
- [ ] 4 oz feta cheese, cubed
- [ ] Fresh vegetables (bell peppers, radishes, green onions)
- [ ] Hot tea or Arabic coffee

## Recipe

### Make the Dough

1. In a small bowl, combine warm water, sugar, and yeast; let stand 5-10 minutes until foamy
2. In a large bowl, whisk together flour and salt
3. Add yeast mixture and olive oil to flour
4. Mix until a shaggy dough forms
5. Knead on a lightly floured surface for 8-10 minutes until smooth and elastic (or use stand mixer with dough hook for 5 minutes)
6. Place dough in an oiled bowl, turning to coat
7. Cover with a damp towel and let rise in a warm place for 1 hour until doubled in size

### Prepare Za'atar Topping

8. In a small bowl, mix za'atar with olive oil until it forms a spreadable paste
9. Set aside while dough rises

### Shape and Top

10. Punch down dough and divide into 6-8 equal portions
11. Roll each portion into a ball, cover with a damp towel, and let rest for 15-20 minutes
12. Preheat oven to 450°F with a pizza stone or inverted baking sheet inside
13. On a lightly floured surface, roll each ball into a 6-7 inch round, about 1/4 inch thick
14. Use your fingertips to dimple the surface of the dough (prevents excessive puffing and helps toppings adhere)
15. Spread 1-2 tablespoons za'atar mixture over each round, leaving a 1/2 inch border

### Bake

16. Carefully transfer flatbreads to the preheated pizza stone or baking sheet (work in batches)
17. Bake for 6-8 minutes until edges are lightly golden and bread is cooked through
18. Remove from oven and brush edges with additional olive oil if desired

### Prepare Accompaniments

19. While flatbreads bake, arrange tomatoes, cucumbers, olives, feta, and fresh vegetables on a serving platter
20. Place labneh in a small bowl and top with fresh mint leaves and a drizzle of olive oil
21. Brew hot tea or Arabic coffee

### Serve

22. Serve manakish warm, allowing guests to fold or roll flatbreads with fresh vegetables and labneh
23. Alternatively, top flatbreads with fresh vegetables and roll up like a wrap

## Notes

- **Quick version:** Use store-bought pizza dough or naan bread, brush with za'atar oil, and bake at 400°F for 8-10 minutes
- **Cheese variation:** Top with crumbled feta, halloumi, or akkawi cheese along with or instead of za'atar
- **Spinach variation:** Sauté 8 oz chopped spinach with garlic, cumin, and coriander; spread on dough with cheese before baking
- **Make-ahead:** Roll out dough rounds, layer between parchment paper, and refrigerate up to 3 days or freeze up to 3 months; top and bake as needed
- **Storage:** Store baked manakish in airtight container in refrigerator up to 1 week; reheat in 350°F oven for 5 minutes or freeze for up to 3 months
- **Meal planning:** This Lebanese breakfast spread serves 4-6 people and includes vegetables, dairy, bread, and beverages for a complete meal
- **Traditional serving:** Manakish is commonly eaten for breakfast in Lebanon, either as a wrap with fresh vegetables or alongside a mezze spread
- Manakish means "engraved" in Arabic, referring to the dimpling of the dough
