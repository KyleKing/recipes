1. In a large bowl, combine everything except for the canola oil and quartered lemons. Pat the chicken dry then rub with the marinade. Refrigerate for 2-24 hours.
2. Heat a large cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. Add the canola oil, the chicken (skin-side down), and then weigh down with the bricks.
3. Cook for 7 minutes. Remove the bricks and flip the chicken. Cook for 7-9 minutes. Check that the chicken is fully cooked by piercing the thickest part with a knife and verify that none of the juices are pink.
