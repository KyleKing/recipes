## Notes

- Press tofu for at least 15 minutes before cooking for best crispiness
- Tear oyster mushrooms into strips along their natural grain for better texture
- Can substitute shiitake or button mushrooms if oyster mushrooms are unavailable
- Make components ahead and assemble bowls when ready to serve
- For extra protein, add a fried or soft-boiled egg on top
- The red cabbage will turn a beautiful purple color as it cooks
