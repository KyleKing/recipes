## Recipe

### Make the Bara

1. In a large bowl, combine flour, salt, yeast, baking powder, sugar, turmeric, and cumin
2. Gradually add lukewarm water while mixing until a soft, slightly sticky dough forms (you may not need all the water)
3. Knead for 5-8 minutes until smooth and elastic
4. Rub dough with 1 tablespoon oil, cover with a damp cloth, and let rise in a warm place for 1.5-2 hours until doubled in size
5. Punch down dough and divide into 16 equal pieces, rolling each into a ball
6. Cover balls with a damp cloth and let rest for 15-30 minutes

### Make the Channa

7. While dough is rising, heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet or pot over medium heat
8. Add onion and cook until softened, about 5 minutes
9. Add garlic and cook for 1 minute until fragrant
10. Stir in curry powder, cumin, turmeric, and amchar masala; cook for 1-2 minutes to toast spices
11. Add chickpeas and stir to coat with spice mixture
12. Pour in 1 cup water, add salt and black pepper
13. Bring to a simmer, then reduce heat and cook for 20-25 minutes, stirring occasionally and adding more water if needed to maintain a thick, gravy-like consistency
14. Use the back of a spoon to lightly mash some chickpeas for a creamier texture
15. Stir in fresh cilantro and hot pepper sauce if using; adjust seasoning
16. Keep warm while frying bara

### Fry the Bara

17. Heat about 2 inches of vegetable oil in a deep pot or skillet to 350-375°F (medium-high heat)
18. On an oiled surface or between oiled hands, flatten each dough ball into a 5-6 inch round, about 1/4 inch thick
19. Carefully slide one round into the hot oil; it should puff up immediately
20. Fry for 15-30 seconds per side until golden brown and puffy
21. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels
22. Stack fried bara to keep warm and allow them to steam slightly and soften

### Assemble

23. Place one bara on a plate, add 2-3 tablespoons of channa in the center
24. Add desired condiments (cucumber chutney, tamarind sauce, pepper sauce)
25. Top with a second bara, pressing gently to create a sandwich
26. Serve immediately while warm

## Notes

- For more authentic flavor, use 1/2 lb dried chickpeas: soak overnight with 1/2 teaspoon baking soda, drain, rinse, then boil in fresh water with 1/2 teaspoon baking soda for 1 hour until tender before proceeding with step 7
- Culantro (also called bandhaniya or shadow beni) is traditional but cilantro works well as a substitute
- Bara should be soft, pillowy, and flexible, not dense or crispy
- The dough can rise for up to 6 hours for even better flavor and texture
- Makes approximately 8 doubles (16 bara)
- This is Trinidad's most popular street food, originating in Princes Town in 1936 when customers requested a second piece of bara to sandwich the channa filling, thus creating "doubles"
