## Recipe

### Make the Quick Pickles

1. In a medium bowl, combine rice vinegar, water, sugar, and salt. Stir until sugar dissolves
1. Add julienned carrot and daikon. Let sit for at least 30 minutes (can be made up to 2 weeks ahead)

### Prepare the Nuoc Cham Sauce

1. In a bowl, combine fish sauce, lime juice, water, and sugar. Stir until sugar dissolves
1. Add minced garlic, chili peppers, and rice vinegar. Set aside (flavors improve as it sits)

### Cook the Rice

1. Rinse brown rice under cold water until water runs clear
1. Combine rice and water in a pot or rice cooker. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 40-45 minutes until tender
1. Remove from heat and let sit covered for 10 minutes, then fluff with a fork

### Make the Meatballs or Tofu

1. In a large bowl, combine your chosen protein with garlic, lemongrass, shallots, fish sauce, brown sugar, oil, black pepper, and salt
1. For meat: Mix gently until just combined (don't overmix). Form into small meatballs (~1.5 inches) or flatten into small patties
1. For tofu: Mix thoroughly and form into patties
1. Cooking options:
   - Air fry: 375F for 12-15 minutes, flipping halfway, until golden and cooked through (internal temp 165F for meat)
   - Pan fry: Heat 1 Tbsp oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook meatballs/patties 3-4 minutes per side until golden and cooked through
   - Broil: Place on a foil-lined baking sheet. Broil 4-5 inches from heat for 5-6 minutes per side

### Assemble Bowls

1. Start with a base of brown rice in each bowl
1. Add a handful of mixed greens, cucumber slices, and pickled vegetables
1. Top with meatballs or tofu patties
1. Garnish with crushed peanuts, green onions, fresh mint, and cilantro
1. Serve with nuoc cham sauce on the side or drizzled over the bowl, plus lime wedges

## Notes

- **Traditional preparation:** Uses white rice or rice vermicelli noodles. Brown rice adds fiber and has lower glycemic impact but changes the texture
- **Flavor/texture tradeoff with brown rice:** Brown rice is chewier and nuttier than white rice. For a more traditional texture while keeping it healthier, try a 50/50 white/brown jasmine rice blend, or use rice vermicelli noodles
- **Lemongrass substitute:** If fresh lemongrass is unavailable, use lemongrass paste (found in the produce section) or substitute with 1 tsp lime zest + 1 tsp grated ginger
- **Daikon substitute:** If daikon is hard to find, use all carrots for the pickles, or add thinly sliced radishes
- **Make ahead:** Pickles last 2 weeks. Sauce lasts 1 week. Meatballs can be shaped and frozen raw, or cooked and refrigerated for 3-4 days
- **Meal prep:** This bowl reheats well. Store components separately and assemble when ready to eat
