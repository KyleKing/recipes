## Recipe

### Make the Quick Pickles

1. In a medium bowl, combine rice vinegar, water, sugar, and salt. Stir until sugar dissolves
1. Add julienned carrot and daikon. Let sit for at least 30 minutes (can be made up to 2 weeks ahead)

### Prepare the Nuoc Cham Sauce

1. In a bowl, combine fish sauce, lime juice, water, and sugar. Stir until sugar dissolves
1. Add minced garlic, chili peppers, and rice vinegar. Set aside (flavors improve as it sits)

### Cook the Rice

1. Rinse brown rice under cold water until water runs clear
1. Combine rice and water in a pot or rice cooker. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 40-45 minutes until tender
1. Remove from heat and let sit covered for 10 minutes, then fluff with a fork

### Make the Meatballs

1. In a large bowl, combine ground meat with garlic, lemongrass, shallots, fish sauce, brown sugar, oil, black pepper, and salt
1. Mix gently until just combined (don't overmix). Form into small meatballs (~1.5 inches) or flatten into small patties
1. Cooking options:
   - Air fry: 375F for 12-15 minutes, flipping halfway, until golden and cooked through (internal temp 165F)
   - Pan fry: Heat 1 Tbsp oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook meatballs/patties 3-4 minutes per side until golden and cooked through
   - Broil: Place on a foil-lined baking sheet. Broil 4-5 inches from heat for 5-6 minutes per side

### Prepare the Tofu (Alternative Method)

1. Press tofu for at least 30 minutes, then cut into 1-inch cubes
1. Make marinade: In a bowl, whisk together tamari, sambal oelek, lime juice, maple syrup, garlic, ginger, and sesame oil
1. Reserve 3/4 of the marinade in a separate container for later use as dressing
1. Pour remaining 1/4 of marinade over tofu cubes in a shallow container. Marinate for minimum 30 minutes or up to overnight, occasionally spooning marinade over exposed cubes
1. After marinating, remove tofu from marinade and pat dry. Toss with cornstarch until evenly coated for extra crispiness
1. Cooking options:
   - Bake: Heat oven to 400F. Arrange cornstarch-coated tofu on parchment-lined baking sheet. Bake 25-30 minutes, flipping halfway, until golden and crispy
   - Air fry: 375F for 15-18 minutes, shaking basket halfway through
   - Pan fry: Heat 1 Tbsp oil in skillet over medium-high heat. Cook tofu cubes 3-4 minutes per side until golden on all sides

### Assemble Bowls

1. Start with a base of brown rice in each bowl
1. Add a handful of mixed greens, cucumber slices, and pickled vegetables
1. Top with meatballs or tofu cubes
1. Garnish with crushed peanuts, green onions, fresh mint, and cilantro
1. For meat version: Serve with nuoc cham sauce on the side or drizzled over the bowl
1. For tofu version: Drizzle with reserved tofu marinade/dressing (the 3/4 you set aside)
1. Serve with lime wedges

## Notes

- **Lemongrass substitute:** Use lemongrass paste (2 tsp per stalk) or 1 Tbsp lemon zest + 1 tsp grated ginger per stalk
- **Sambal oelek substitute:** Equal amount sriracha, or 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes + 1/2 tsp rice vinegar per 1 tsp sambal
- **Dark soy sauce substitute:** Regular soy sauce + 1/4 tsp molasses or brown sugar per 1 Tbsp dark soy
- **Thai chili substitute:** Serrano peppers, or 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes per chili
- **Daikon substitute:** Use all carrots for the pickles, or add thinly sliced radishes
- **Cornstarch coating:** The cornstarch coating on tofu creates extra crispiness. Pat tofu dry after marinating before tossing with cornstarch
- **Tofu marinade efficiency:** The Lazy Cat Kitchen method uses one marinade for both marinating and dressing, saving time and reducing waste
- **Oyster mushrooms:** Tear along natural grain for better texture. Can substitute shiitake or button mushrooms. Sauté in oil until browned (4-5 minutes) or add raw for crunch
- **Red cabbage variation:** For a cooked cabbage option, stir-fry sliced red cabbage with soy sauce and rice vinegar for 5-7 minutes until softened but still crunchy. Adds color and nutrients
- **Make ahead:** Pickles last 2 weeks. Nuoc cham sauce lasts 1 week. Tofu marinade/dressing lasts 1 week. Meatballs can be shaped and frozen raw, or cooked and refrigerated for 3-4 days. Marinated tofu can be cooked and refrigerated for 4-5 days
- **Meal prep:** This bowl reheats well. Store components separately and assemble when ready to eat. For tofu version, store reserved marinade separately and drizzle when serving
