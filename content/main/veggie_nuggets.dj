## Ingredients

- [ ] 2 cups broccoli florets (fresh or frozen)
- [ ] 1 cup cauliflower florets (fresh or frozen)
- [ ] 1 medium carrot, peeled and chopped
- [ ] 2 cloves garlic, minced
- [ ] 1 cup cooked white or brown rice (cooled)
- [ ] 2 large eggs
- [ ] 1 cup shredded cheddar cheese
- [ ] 3/4 cup breadcrumbs or panko (plus extra for coating)
- [ ] 1/2 tsp salt
- [ ] 1/4 tsp black pepper
- [ ] 1/4 tsp garlic powder
- [ ] 1/4 tsp onion powder
- [ ] Cooking spray or olive oil

## Recipe

1. Preheat oven to 375°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and spray with cooking spray
1. If using fresh vegetables, steam broccoli and cauliflower until tender (5-7 min). If frozen, thaw and squeeze out excess moisture with paper towels
1. Add broccoli, cauliflower, carrot, and garlic to food processor. Pulse until finely chopped but not pureed (small rice-sized pieces)
1. Transfer vegetables to large bowl. Add cooked rice, eggs, cheese, breadcrumbs, salt, pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder. Mix until well combined
1. Place extra breadcrumbs in shallow dish. Scoop 1-2 Tbsp of mixture and form into nugget shape. Roll in breadcrumbs to coat
1. Place nuggets on prepared baking sheet, spacing 1 inch apart. Spray tops lightly with cooking spray
1. Bake 15-18 minutes, flip, then bake another 12-15 minutes until golden brown and crispy
1. Cool 5 minutes before serving. Serve with ketchup, ranch, or honey mustard for dipping

## Notes

- **Freezer-friendly**: Freeze unbaked nuggets on baking sheet until solid, then transfer to freezer bag. Bake from frozen at 375°F for 25-30 minutes, flipping halfway
- **Air fryer option**: Cook at 375°F for 10-12 minutes, flipping halfway through
- **Vegetable variations**: Substitute or add zucchini, sweet potato, spinach, or bell peppers
- **Make ahead**: Mixture can be refrigerated for up to 24 hours before forming nuggets
- **Binding issues**: If mixture is too wet, add more breadcrumbs. If too dry, add another egg
- **Kid involvement**: Let kids help form nuggets and choose dipping sauces
