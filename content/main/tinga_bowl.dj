## Recipe

### Make the Tinga Sauce

1. In a blender, combine fire-roasted tomatoes, chipotle peppers, adobo sauce, garlic, oregano, cumin, smoked paprika, salt, and pepper
1. Blend until smooth. Set aside

### Cook the Rice

1. Rinse brown rice until water runs clear
1. In a pot or rice cooker, combine rice and water/broth. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 40-45 minutes
1. Remove from heat, let sit covered for 10 minutes, then fluff with a fork
1. Stir in lime juice, cilantro, butter/oil, and salt to taste

### Cook the Protein and Vegetables

1. Heat 2 Tbsp olive oil in a large skillet or Dutch oven over medium-high heat
1. Add sliced onions and bell peppers. Cook until softened, 5-6 minutes. Remove and set aside
1. In the same pan, add protein:
   - For chicken: Cook chicken strips 5-6 minutes until cooked through (or shred pre-cooked chicken and add)
   - For ground turkey: Cook, breaking up with a spoon, until browned, 6-8 minutes
   - For tofu: Cook cubes 4-5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until golden
1. Pour tinga sauce over the protein. Add onions and peppers back to the pan
1. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for 10-15 minutes, allowing flavors to meld and sauce to thicken slightly
1. If using chicken thighs whole, shred with two forks after simmering

### Warm the Black Beans and Corn

1. In a small pot, warm black beans and corn together over medium heat, 3-4 minutes. Season with salt

### Assemble Bowls

1. Divide cilantro-lime rice among serving bowls
1. Top with tinga (protein with sauce), black beans, and corn
1. Add sliced avocado, crumbled queso fresco, pickled jalapeños, and fresh cilantro
1. Drizzle with chipotle crema and serve with lime wedges

## Notes

- **Traditional preparation:** Often uses white rice, which cooks in 15-20 minutes and has a lighter, fluffier texture
- **Flavor/texture tradeoff with brown rice:** Brown rice is chewier and nuttier. The lime juice and cilantro help keep it fresh and bright. For a lighter texture, use white rice or a 50/50 blend
- **Spice level:** Start with 2 chipotle peppers and add more to taste. The adobo sauce adds flavor without too much heat
- **Sheet pan method:** For easier cleanup, toss chicken/tofu, onions, and peppers with tinga sauce and roast at 425F for 20-25 minutes
- **Make ahead:** Tinga sauce can be made 3-5 days ahead. Cooked tinga lasts 3-4 days refrigerated or 3 months frozen
- **Meal prep:** Store components separately. Tinga and rice reheat well. Add fresh toppings when serving
- **Protein variations:** Shredded rotisserie chicken works great for a quick version. Ground beef or pork also work well
