## Notes

- Versatile filling for tacos, tostadas, burrito bowls, stuffed peppers, or quesadillas
- Adjust chipotle amount based on heat preference (start with 1 pepper for mild)
- Much lower saturated fat than traditional chicken or pork tinga
- Stores well in refrigerator for 4-5 days; freezes well
- Brown lentils (similar to green) hold their shape well for this filling and provide a peppery flavor that complements the smoky chipotle
- For toddlers: Reserve portion before adding chipotle, or serve with cooling toppings like avocado and sour cream
