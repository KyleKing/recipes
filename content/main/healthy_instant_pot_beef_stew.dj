## Ingredients

- [ ] 1 tbsp olive oil or avocado oil
- [ ] 1½–2 lb beef chuck or top sirloin, trimmed and cut into 1½-inch chunks
- [ ] 1 large onion, diced
- [ ] 3 carrots, cut into chunks
- [ ] 2 celery stalks, sliced
- [ ] 1 cup mushrooms, quartered (optional)
- [ ] 3 cloves garlic, minced
- [ ] 1 tbsp tomato paste
- [ ] 3 cups low-sodium beef broth
- [ ] 1 lb baby potatoes, halved
- [ ] 1 tsp kosher salt (adjust later)

- [ ] 1 tsp smoked paprika
- [ ] 1 tsp dried thyme or rosemary
- [ ] 1 bay leaf
- [ ] 1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce or tamari
- [ ] Optional: 1 tsp soy sauce or miso

## Recipe

1. **Sauté** – Set Instant Pot to Sauté (High). Add oil and brown beef in batches (don't crowd). Remove beef and set aside.

2. **Aromatics** – Add onion, carrot, celery, mushrooms. Cook 4–5 minutes until lightly softened. Add garlic and tomato paste; cook 30 seconds.

3. **Deglaze** – Splash in a bit of broth and scrape the bottom well.

4. **Pressure cook** – Return beef to pot. Add remaining broth, seasonings, Worcestershire, bay leaf. Lock lid. Cook 35 minutes on High Pressure. Natural release 10 minutes, then quick release.

5. **Finish** – Taste and adjust salt/acid (a splash of vinegar or lemon brightens it). Remove bay leaf.

## Notes

**Healthier modifications:**

- Leaner beef (top sirloin, round, or bison)
- No flour thickening - mash a few potatoes in the pot instead, or blend ½ cup stew liquid + veg and stir back in
- Extra vegetables for fiber

**Smarter starch choices:**

- Half potatoes + half turnips or rutabaga
- Sweet potatoes (lower glycemic load)
- White beans or chickpeas (fiber + protein boost)

**Flavor upgrades:**

- 1 anchovy melted into the onions
- Parmesan rind during cooking (remove at end)
- Splash of sherry vinegar or red wine vinegar
- Fresh herbs at the end (parsley + thyme)

**Extra vegetable boost** (add after pressure cooking and simmer on sauté):

- Kale, chard, or spinach
- Frozen peas or green beans
- Zucchini or fennel

**Storage:**

- Tastes better day 2–3
- Freezes extremely well
- Skim fat after chilling for even leaner result
