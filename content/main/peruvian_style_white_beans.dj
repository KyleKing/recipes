## Ingredients

- [ ] 2 Tbsp olive oil or vegetable oil
- [ ] 1 medium onion, diced
- [ ] 3 cloves garlic, minced
- [ ] 1 tsp ground cumin
- [ ] 1/2 tsp paprika (smoked or sweet)
- [ ] 1/4 tsp ground turmeric (for color)
- [ ] 2 cans (15 oz each) white beans (cannellini or Great Northern), drained and rinsed (or 3.5 cups cooked beans)
- [ ] 1 cup vegetable broth or water
- [ ] 1 tsp salt (or to taste)
- [ ] 1/4 tsp black pepper
- [ ] 1 bay leaf
- [ ] (Optional) 1 ají amarillo pepper or jalapeño, minced
- [ ] (Optional) 2 Tbsp fresh cilantro, chopped

## Recipe

1. Heat oil in a large skillet or saucepan over medium heat
1. Add onion and cook until softened and translucent (5-7 min)
1. Add garlic, cumin, paprika, and turmeric; cook until fragrant (~1 min)
1. Add optional ají amarillo or jalapeño if using
1. Add beans, broth, salt, pepper, and bay leaf. Stir to combine
1. Bring to a simmer, then reduce heat to medium-low. Cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, until liquid reduces and beans are creamy (10-15 min). Lightly mash some beans against the side of the pan for a creamier texture
1. Remove bay leaf. Taste and adjust seasoning
1. Optionally stir in fresh cilantro and lime juice before serving

## Notes

- Serve as a side dish, taco filling, over rice, or as a base for tacu tacu (Peruvian bean and rice patties)
- For tacu tacu: Mix cooked beans with cooked rice, form into patties, and pan-fry until crispy on both sides
- Ají amarillo is a Peruvian yellow pepper that adds authentic flavor but can be substituted with jalapeño
- Bean alternatives: Pinto beans or black beans work well with these seasonings and are widely available in US grocery stores
- For Instant Pot: Sauté onion and spices using sauté mode, add remaining ingredients, cook on high pressure for 5 minutes, then quick release
