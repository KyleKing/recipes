## Recipe

### Marinate the Tofu

1. Press tofu for at least 30 minutes to remove excess moisture, then cut into 1-inch cubes
1. In a bowl or ziplock bag, whisk together olive oil, garlic, lemon zest, lemon juice, thyme, rosemary, parsley, oregano, salt, pepper, and water
1. Add tofu cubes and toss to coat. Refrigerate for minimum 30 minutes or up to overnight

### Cook the Grains

1. Rinse quinoa or farro under cold water
1. Combine grains and water/broth in a pot. Bring to a boil
1. For quinoa: Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer 15 minutes. Let sit covered 5 minutes, then fluff
1. For farro: Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer 25-30 minutes until tender. Drain excess liquid if needed

### Roast the Tofu and Vegetables

1. Heat oven to 425°F and line two baking sheets with parchment paper
1. Remove tofu from marinade (reserve marinade) and spread on one baking sheet in a single layer
1. On second baking sheet, toss cherry tomatoes, zucchini, bell pepper, and red onion with olive oil, salt, and pepper
1. Roast both sheets for 20-25 minutes, flipping tofu halfway through and tossing vegetables once, until tofu is golden and vegetables are caramelized

### Make Tahini Dressing

1. In a small bowl, whisk together tahini, lemon juice, olive oil, and garlic
1. Add water 1 tablespoon at a time until dressing reaches pourable consistency
1. Season with salt to taste

### Assemble Bowls

1. Divide quinoa or farro among bowls
1. Top with mixed greens, roasted tofu, roasted vegetables, chickpeas, and olives
1. Sprinkle with feta if using
1. Drizzle with tahini lemon dressing and any reserved tofu marinade

## Notes

- **Meal prep advantage**: All components can be prepared in advance and stored separately for 4-5 days. Assemble bowls fresh with greens and dressing
- **Tahini substitute**: Equal amount sunflower seed butter, almond butter, or cashew butter. For dressing only, Greek yogurt works
- **Grain alternatives**: Use brown rice, couscous, or bulgur wheat instead of quinoa/farro
- **Herb substitutes**: If fresh herbs unavailable, use all dried (1 tsp each thyme, rosemary, oregano; 2 tsp dried parsley). Let marinade sit longer for flavors to develop
- **Protein boost**: Add hard-boiled eggs or white beans for additional protein
- **Make it Greek**: Add cucumber, use orzo instead of quinoa, and serve with tzatziki instead of tahini dressing
- **Summer variation**: Grill marinated tofu and vegetables instead of roasting for smoky flavor
