## Ingredients

- [ ] 1 (14- to 16-ounce) block firm tofu, well drained
- [ ] 1 pound asparagus (about 1 bunch), trimmed
- [ ] 3 tablespoons neutral-flavored oil (such as grapeseed or peanut oil)
- [ ] Salt
- [ ] 2 garlic cloves, finely chopped
- [ ] ½ teaspoon red-pepper flakes, plus more for serving
- [ ] 2 tablespoons white or light miso
- [ ] 1 tablespoon sake (or use white wine or vermouth)
- [ ] 1 tablespoon rice vinegar
- [ ] 1 tablespoon mirin
- [ ] 1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil
- [ ] Sliced scallions, for garnish

## Recipe

1. Heat the broiler and place an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source. Line a rimmed sheet pan with foil if you like (for easier clean-up). Cut tofu into 1-inch cubes, then dry with a clean kitchen towel or paper towels to absorb as much moisture as possible.
1. Put asparagus and tofu on the prepared pan and toss gently with 2 tablespoons oil. Spread everything out in one layer and season lightly with salt.
1. Slide pan under the broiler and broil until speckled lightly with brown, 3 to 6 minutes. Flip tofu and asparagus, then continue to broil until asparagus is tender and tofu is deeply browned in spots, 3 to 7 minutes longer, depending on the size of the asparagus and power of your broiler.
1. While the asparagus broils, make the miso-chile sauce. Heat a skillet over medium heat, then add remaining 1 tablespoon oil and heat until it thins out, about 30 seconds. Add garlic and red-pepper flakes to the pan; cook until fragrant, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Turn off the heat. Whisk in miso, sake, vinegar, mirin and sesame oil.
1. Remove pan from oven, slather miso mixture over the asparagus and tofu, and return to broiler for another 30 seconds to 2 minutes, until the miso mixture bubbles and glazes everything (watch carefully so nothing burns). Transfer asparagus and tofu to a serving platter and garnish with more red-pepper flakes, if you like, and sliced scallions. Serve hot or warm.

## Notes

- Broiling asparagus gives it a charred exterior but still keeps the vegetables soft and sweet within. Served over rice or noodles, it makes a salty, spicy and deeply flavored meal that's ready in less than half an hour.

- **Ingredient alternatives:**
  - Sake: Substitute with white wine or dry vermouth. For non-alcoholic, use 1 tablespoon water (simplest option - the miso, garlic, and sesame oil provide plenty of flavor).
  - Mirin: Substitute with 1 tablespoon rice vinegar + 1 teaspoon sugar, or use white wine with a pinch of sugar
  - Miso: White miso (shiro miso) is milder and sweeter; yellow miso is slightly stronger; red miso is more intense and salty. Light miso works well here for a balanced flavor.
