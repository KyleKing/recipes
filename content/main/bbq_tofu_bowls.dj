- [ ] 2 (14-ounce) blocks extra-firm tofu, pressed and cut into 1-inch cubes
- [ ] 3 tablespoons vegetable oil
- [ ] 3 cloves garlic, minced
- [ ] 2 tablespoons vegan Worcestershire sauce
- [ ] 1 tablespoon smoked paprika
- [ ] 3 tablespoons light brown sugar
- [ ] 1/4 cup tomato puree
- [ ] 2 tablespoons dark soy sauce (or regular soy sauce)
- [ ] 2 tablespoons water

### Bowl Components

- [ ] 2 cups long-grain rice (white or brown)
- [ ] 3 cups water (4.5 cups for brown rice)
- [ ] 1 pound broccoli florets (or Brussels sprouts, halved)
- [ ] 2 tablespoons olive oil
- [ ] Salt and black pepper
- [ ] 2 cups corn kernels (fresh or frozen)
- [ ] 4 green onions, thinly sliced
- [ ] 2 tablespoons toasted sesame seeds (optional)

## Recipe

### Marinate the Tofu

1. Press tofu for at least 30 minutes to remove excess moisture, then cut into 1-inch cubes
1. In a bowl or ziplock bag, whisk together vegetable oil, garlic, Worcestershire sauce, smoked paprika, brown sugar, tomato puree, dark soy sauce, and water
1. Add tofu cubes and toss to coat. Refrigerate for minimum 30 minutes or up to overnight

### Cook the Rice

1. Rinse rice under cold water until water runs clear
1. Combine rice and water in a pot. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer 15 minutes for white rice or 40-45 minutes for brown rice
1. Remove from heat and let sit covered for 10 minutes, then fluff with a fork

### Roast the Tofu and Vegetables

1. Heat oven to 425°F and line two baking sheets with parchment paper
1. Toss broccoli florets with olive oil, salt, and pepper on one baking sheet
1. Remove tofu from marinade (reserve marinade) and spread on second baking sheet in a single layer
1. Roast both sheets for 15 minutes
1. Flip tofu pieces, toss broccoli, and roast another 10-15 minutes until tofu is caramelized and broccoli is crispy at edges
1. While tofu finishes roasting, heat reserved marinade in a small saucepan over medium heat until thickened, about 3-5 minutes. Toss tofu with thickened sauce

### Prepare Corn (Optional)

1. If using fresh corn, char in a dry skillet over high heat for 3-4 minutes until slightly blackened
1. If using frozen corn, thaw and pat dry, then char in skillet

### Assemble Bowls

1. Divide rice among bowls
1. Top with BBQ tofu, roasted broccoli, and corn
1. Garnish with sliced green onions and sesame seeds

## Notes

- **Meal prep advantage**: All components can be prepared in advance and stored separately for 4-5 days. Reheat tofu in oven at 375°F for 5-7 minutes to restore crispiness, or enjoy cold
- **Vegan Worcestershire substitute**: 2 Tbsp soy sauce + 1 Tbsp balsamic vinegar per 2 Tbsp Worcestershire
- **Dark soy sauce substitute**: Regular soy sauce + 1/4 tsp molasses or brown sugar per 1 Tbsp dark soy
- **Alternative vegetables**: Sweet potato cubes, cauliflower, or bell peppers work well with BBQ flavors
- **Sandwich option**: Use BBQ tofu in sandwiches with coleslaw and pickles on toasted buns
- **Air fryer method**: After marinating, air fry tofu at 400°F for 15-18 minutes, shaking basket halfway through. Toss with thickened marinade after cooking
- **For crispier tofu**: Toss marinated tofu with 1-2 tablespoons cornstarch before roasting
