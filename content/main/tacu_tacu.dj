## Ingredients

### For the Patties

- [ ] 2-3 tablespoons oil (coconut or olive oil)
- [ ] 1 medium red onion, finely diced
- [ ] 3 cloves garlic, minced
- [ ] ¼ cup aji amarillo paste
- [ ] 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- [ ] 1½ cups canary beans (or mayocoba, peruano beans), cooked and well-drained
- [ ] 1½ cups white rice, cooked (ideally day-old rice)
- [ ] Salt and black pepper to taste

### Salsa Criolla (Traditional Accompaniment)

- [ ] 1 red onion, thinly sliced lengthwise
- [ ] 1 aji amarillo, deseeded and sliced
- [ ] 1 handful cilantro, chopped
- [ ] 1-2 limes, juiced
- [ ] ½ teaspoon salt (plus more for soaking)

## Recipe

### Prepare Salsa Criolla

1. Thinly slice red onion lengthwise, removing outer layers
1. Soak sliced onion in cold salted water for 5 minutes to mellow sharpness, then drain and rinse thoroughly
1. Combine lime juice, ½ teaspoon salt, deseeded aji amarillo slices, and chopped cilantro with drained onion
1. Mix well and set aside to develop flavors while cooking tacu tacu

### Form and Cook the Patties

1. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat
1. Cook diced onion and garlic until softened, about 7-9 minutes
1. Add aji amarillo paste and oregano, cooking 2-3 minutes longer until fragrant
1. Pulse half the beans in a food processor until roughly mashed (or mash by hand with a fork)
1. Add all beans (mashed and whole) and rice to the skillet with the onion mixture
1. Mix thoroughly until well combined. Season with salt and black pepper to taste
1. Shape mixture into oval patties resembling small footballs (makes 4-6 patties)
1. Heat 1-2 tablespoons oil in a clean non-stick skillet over medium heat
1. Cook patties 3-4 minutes per side without moving them until golden and crispy, flipping once
1. Serve hot with salsa criolla on top

## Notes

- Day-old rice works best as it's drier and forms better patties. Freshly cooked rice can be too sticky
- Canary beans are traditional, but pinto or black beans work as substitutes
- Aji amarillo paste is available at Latin markets or online. Substitute with a mix of yellow bell pepper and a small amount of jalapeño if unavailable
- For baking alternative: Place shaped patties on an oiled baking sheet with spacing. Bake at 400°F for 30 minutes, flipping halfway through
- Traditionally served for breakfast or lunch, often topped with a fried egg, steak, or plantains
- The dish originated in colonial Peru as a way to use leftover beans and rice, creating a flavorful "comida criolla" (creole cuisine) staple
- Store leftover patties in an airtight container for up to 3 days. Reheat in a skillet to restore crispiness
