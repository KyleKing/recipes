Previously included 1 Tbsp chili powder and 1/2 tsp of the rest, but I calculated an approximate substitute based on: [https://www.spendwithpennies.com/homemade-chili-powde/...](https://www.spendwithpennies.com/homemade-chili-powder)

- [ ] 3/4 tsp cumin

- [ ] 2 avocados, diced
- [ ] 2 limes, diced
- [ ] 2 tomatoes, diced
- [ ] 1 small bunch cilantro, remove and mince the leaves
- [ ] (Optional) salsa

## Recipe

1. Pour 1 cup of water and place the trivet in the Instant Pot

  1. Remove _most of_ the leaves from the Cauliflower
  1. Cook for "0" min at high pressure (if longer, will be too soft)
  1. Once at pressure, quick release
  1. Remove the cauliflower to cool
1. Prep the spice mix
1. In a large skillet, on medium heat, saute the onion with half of the spices
1. Rinse the rice and store in 2-cup measure (and save strainer for beans and corn)

  1. In the Instant Pot, combine rice and water at a 1:1.5 ratio with broth or water
  1. Cook for 8 min at high pressure
  1. Quick release
  1. Add juice of 1 lime per cup of rice and fluff
1. Add the beans and corn to the pan
1. Once cool enough, remove the remaining leaves, chop the cauliflower into bite size pieces, and add to the pan

  1. Coat with remaining spices
1. Serve in bowls with diced toppings

## Notes

1. The cauliflower can also be roasted at >425F. Chop into bite size pieces, coat with olive oil and half of spices, then roast for 20 minutes
