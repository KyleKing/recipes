- [ ] 1/4 cup water
- [ ] 2 tablespoons sugar

### For Assembly

- [ ] 1/4 cup mayonnaise (vegan if desired)
- [ ] 1 tablespoon sriracha (optional, mix with mayo)
- [ ] 1 cucumber, thinly sliced lengthwise into ribbons
- [ ] 1 jalapeño, thinly sliced
- [ ] 1 cup fresh cilantro sprigs
- [ ] 1/2 cup fresh mint leaves
- [ ] Maggi seasoning sauce or soy sauce for drizzling (optional)

## Recipe

### Make Quick Pickles

1. In a medium bowl, combine rice vinegar, water, sugar, and salt. Stir until sugar dissolves
1. Add julienned carrot and daikon. Let sit for at least 30 minutes (can be made up to 2 weeks ahead)

### Marinate the Tofu

1. Press tofu for at least 30 minutes, then slice into 1/2-inch thick planks (about 3-4 planks per block)
1. If using fresh lemongrass: Remove tough outer layers, use only tender white parts, and mince very finely
1. In a bowl or shallow container, whisk together lemongrass (or substitute), vegetable oil, sesame oil, soy sauce, dark soy sauce, garlic, green onions, sugar, chilies, ginger, and water
1. Add tofu planks and spoon marinade over to coat. Refrigerate for minimum 1 hour or up to overnight, flipping once

### Cook the Tofu

1. Heat oven to 425°F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper
1. Remove tofu from marinade (reserve marinade) and arrange planks on baking sheet
1. Roast for 20 minutes, flip, brush with reserved marinade, and roast another 15-20 minutes until caramelized and edges are crispy
1. Alternatively, pan-fry: Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook tofu planks 4-5 minutes per side until golden and caramelized, basting with marinade

### Assemble Banh Mi

1. Slice baguettes lengthwise, leaving one edge attached (hinge-style)
1. Toast bread cut-side up under broiler for 1-2 minutes or in toaster oven until lightly golden
1. Spread mayonnaise (mixed with sriracha if using) on both sides of bread
1. Layer tofu planks on bottom half
1. Top with drained pickled vegetables, cucumber ribbons, jalapeño slices, cilantro sprigs, and mint leaves
1. Drizzle with Maggi or soy sauce if desired
1. Close sandwich and serve immediately

## Notes

- **Lemongrass substitute**: Use lemongrass paste (2 Tbsp) from produce section, or 1 Tbsp lemon zest + 1 tsp grated ginger for citrusy-herbal flavor
- **Bird's eye chili substitute**: Serrano peppers (similar heat), jalapeños (1.5x amount, milder), or 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes per chili
- **Dark soy sauce substitute**: Regular soy sauce + 1/4 tsp molasses or brown sugar per 1 Tbsp dark soy
- **Meal prep advantage**: Pickles last 2 weeks refrigerated. Marinated tofu can be cooked and stored for 4-5 days. Assemble sandwiches fresh for best texture
- **Bread options**: Vietnamese baguettes are lighter and airier than French baguettes. If unavailable, use French rolls or ciabatta rolls
- **Bowl variation**: Skip the bread and serve components over rice or vermicelli noodles as a bun bowl
- **Make it spicier**: Add more bird's eye chilies to marinade or extra sriracha mayo
- **Pâté option**: Traditional banh mi often includes pâté. For vegan version, spread with mushroom pâté or skip entirely
