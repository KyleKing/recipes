## Recipe

### Prepare the Jerk Seasoning and Marinate

1. In a small bowl, combine all jerk seasoning ingredients
1. Reserve 1 Tbsp of jerk seasoning for the rice
1. In a large bowl, toss the protein with remaining jerk seasoning and 1 Tbsp oil. Let marinate for at least 30 minutes (or up to 24 hours refrigerated)

### Make the Rice and Peas

1. In a large pot or Dutch oven with lid, heat 1 Tbsp oil over medium heat
1. Add white parts of green onions and garlic, cook until fragrant (~1 min)
1. Add brown rice and reserved 1 Tbsp jerk seasoning, toast for 2-3 minutes, stirring frequently
1. Add coconut milk, water/broth, kidney beans, thyme sprigs, and whole scotch bonnet pepper (if using)
1. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 40-45 minutes until rice is tender and liquid is absorbed
1. Remove from heat, discard thyme sprigs and scotch bonnet pepper. Stir in green parts of green onions. Keep covered

### Cook the Protein

1. For chicken: Heat 1 Tbsp oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook chicken pieces 5-7 minutes per side until cooked through (internal temp 165F) and slightly charred. Alternatively, air fry at 400F for 12-15 minutes, shaking halfway
1. For tofu: Air fry at 400F for 15-18 minutes until crispy, or pan-fry in 2 Tbsp oil over medium-high heat for 3-4 minutes per side
1. For shrimp: Cook in skillet with 1 Tbsp oil over medium-high heat for 2-3 minutes per side until pink and opaque

### Assemble Bowls

1. Divide rice and peas among serving bowls
1. Top with cooked protein, mango, pickled red onions, avocado, and cilantro
1. Serve with lime wedges and scotch bonnet crema if desired

## Notes

- **Traditional preparation:** Uses white rice and cooks for 20-25 minutes. Brown rice adds fiber and has lower glycemic impact but takes longer to cook
- **Flavor/texture tradeoff with brown rice:** Brown rice has a nuttier, chewier texture compared to fluffy white rice. The coconut milk helps keep it creamy. If you prefer traditional texture, use a 50/50 white/brown rice blend
- **Spice level:** The whole scotch bonnet adds flavor without much heat (don't pierce it). Remove it if concerned about spice
- **Meal prep:** Rice and peas reheat well. Store protein separately and reheat gently to avoid drying out
- **Make ahead:** Pickle the red onions up to 1 week in advance. Marinate protein up to 24 hours ahead
