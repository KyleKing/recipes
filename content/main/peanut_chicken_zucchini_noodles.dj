- [ ] 2 tsp minced or chopped garlic
- [ ] 1 cup shredded carrots
- [ ] 1 cup thinly sliced cabbage (red recommended)
- [ ] 1 large bell pepper, thinly sliced (red recommended)
- [ ] 1.5 lbs (680g) zucchini, spiralized into noodles
- [ ] 2 large chicken breasts, cooked and shredded (about 2-3 cups)

### Peanut Sauce

- [ ] 1/2 cup creamy peanut butter
- [ ] 1/3 cup honey
- [ ] 1/3 cup soy sauce (reduced sodium preferred)
- [ ] 2 Tbsps sesame oil
- [ ] 2 Tbsps rice vinegar
- [ ] 2 tsp fresh ginger, minced
- [ ] 1-2 tsp Sriracha or hot chile sauce

### Optional Toppings

- [ ] 1 Tbsp sesame seeds
- [ ] Cilantro
- [ ] 1/2 cup peanuts
- [ ] 1 Tbsp chopped green onion

## Recipe

1. Heat 2 Tbsps sesame oil and garlic in a large skillet over medium heat. Add carrots, cabbage, and pepper. Cook approximately 5 minutes until tender. Meanwhile, prepare the peanut sauce. Add zucchini noodles and shredded chicken; cook and stir 3 minutes until zucchini softens and chicken warms. Remove from heat and set aside. Process in batches if skillet space is limited.
1. Combine all peanut sauce ingredients in a small saucepan over low heat. Whisk constantly until peanut butter melts and everything combines. Adjust Sriracha to desired heat level.
1. Pour sauce over chicken and vegetables. Toss until combined. Plate and garnish with sesame seeds, cilantro, peanuts, and green onion. Serve immediately.
1. Refrigerate leftovers for a few days. Reheat as preferred.

## Notes

- **Rice vinegar**: Essential for authentic flavor; avoid white wine or white vinegar due to harshness
- **Zucchini**: Pre-spiralized versions available in produce sections, or use a home spiralizer
- **Chicken**: Boil skinless boneless breasts for 12-15 minutes, or use rotisserie chicken, leftover cooked chicken, or substitute with beef, shrimp, salmon, or tofu
- **Ingredient substitutions**: Gluten-free soy sauce or coconut aminos work for soy sauce; almond butter replaces peanut butter for allergies; pasta or rice noodles can replace zucchini noodles
