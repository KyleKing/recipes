## Ingredients

- [ ] 1 lb skirt steak or flank steak
- [ ] 2 tablespoons taco seasoning (or homemade blend: 1 tsp each cumin, chili powder, paprika, garlic powder, oregano)
- [ ] 1 tablespoon olive oil
- [ ] 4 telera or bolillo rolls (or crusty hoagie rolls)
- [ ] 1 cup refried beans (preferably black beans)
- [ ] 1 large avocado, sliced
- [ ] 1 large tomato, sliced
- [ ] ½ red onion, thinly sliced
- [ ] 1 cup shredded lettuce
- [ ] ½ cup queso fresco or Oaxaca cheese, crumbled or shredded
- [ ] ¼ cup Mexican crema or sour cream
- [ ] ¼ cup mayonnaise
- [ ] Pickled jalapeños, to taste
- [ ] Fresh cilantro
- [ ] Salsa or hot sauce

### Optional: Seasoned Black or Pinto Beans (instead of or in addition to refried)

- [ ] 1 can (15 oz) black beans or pinto beans, drained and rinsed
- [ ] 1 tablespoon olive oil
- [ ] 2 cloves garlic, minced
- [ ] 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- [ ] ½ teaspoon chili powder
- [ ] ¼ teaspoon smoked paprika
- [ ] Salt and pepper to taste
- [ ] Squeeze of lime juice

## Recipe

1. Season steak with taco seasoning, rubbing it in well. Let sit for 5-10 minutes at room temperature.

2. Heat olive oil in a skillet or grill pan over medium-high heat. Cook steak 5-6 minutes, flipping halfway through, until medium (internal temp 135-140°F). Remove and let rest 10 minutes, then slice thinly against the grain.

3. While steak rests, prepare beans. For refried beans: warm in a small pan or microwave until spreadable. For seasoned whole beans: heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a small skillet over medium heat, add minced garlic and cook 30 seconds until fragrant. Add drained beans, cumin, chili powder, smoked paprika, salt, and pepper. Cook 3-4 minutes, stirring occasionally and lightly mashing some beans with the back of a spoon. Add squeeze of lime juice and remove from heat.

4. Slice telera rolls in half horizontally. Lightly toast cut sides in a dry skillet over medium heat until golden and slightly crisp, about 2-3 minutes.

5. Spread refried beans on bottom half of each roll. Add a thin layer of mayonnaise or crema on top half.

6. Layer sliced steak on the beans, followed by cheese, tomato slices, avocado, red onion, and lettuce.

7. Top with pickled jalapeños, fresh cilantro, and salsa or hot sauce to taste. Close sandwiches and press gently.

8. Cut each torta in half with a sharp knife and serve immediately while bread is still crisp.

## Notes

- Traditional Mexican bread (telera or bolillo) is ideal for authentic flavor and texture, but any crusty roll works
- Protein variations: grilled chicken, carnitas, chorizo, or scrambled eggs with chorizo for breakfast tortas
- For vegetarian option: substitute grilled vegetables (poblanos, zucchini, mushrooms) or double the beans as the main protein
- Bean options: use refried beans for traditional creamy texture, seasoned whole beans for more texture, or layer both for heartier filling
- Make it healthier: use whole grain rolls, increase vegetable portions, use Greek yogurt instead of crema
- Refried beans can be homemade or canned; black beans are slightly healthier than pinto
- Store cooked steak separately in refrigerator for 3-4 days; assemble sandwiches fresh to prevent soggy bread
- For meal prep: prepare all components separately and assemble just before serving
