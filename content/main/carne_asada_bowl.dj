## Recipe

### Marinate the Protein

1. In a bowl or large zip-top bag, combine lime juice, orange juice, olive oil, garlic, cilantro, jalapeño, soy sauce, cumin, chili powder, paprika, oregano, salt, and pepper
1. Add protein and toss to coat thoroughly
1. Marinate for at least 30 minutes at room temperature, or up to 24 hours refrigerated (longer = more flavor)

### Cook the Rice

1. Rinse brown rice until water runs clear
1. In a pot or rice cooker, combine rice and water/broth. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 40-45 minutes
1. Remove from heat, let sit covered for 10 minutes, then fluff with a fork
1. Stir in lime juice, lime zest, cilantro, butter/oil, and salt to taste

### Make the Charred Corn

1. Heat 1 Tbsp olive oil in a large skillet over high heat
1. Add corn kernels in a single layer. Let cook without stirring for 2-3 minutes until charred on one side
1. Stir and continue cooking 2-3 more minutes until charred in spots
1. Remove from heat, toss with chili powder, cotija cheese (if using), and lime juice. Set aside

### Cook the Protein

1. Remove protein from marinade, letting excess drip off (discard marinade)
1. For steak or chicken:
   - Heat 1 Tbsp oil in a large cast-iron skillet or grill pan over high heat until smoking
   - Cook protein in a single layer, 3-4 minutes per side for steak (medium-rare to medium), 5-6 minutes per side for chicken (internal temp 165F)
   - Don't overcrowd the pan; work in batches if needed
   - Let steak rest 5 minutes before slicing
   - Alternative: Air fry at 400F for 10-12 minutes for chicken, flipping halfway
1. For portobello mushrooms:
   - Heat 2 Tbsp oil in skillet over medium-high heat
   - Cook mushrooms 4-5 minutes per side until tender and browned

### Warm the Black Beans

1. In a small pot, warm black beans over medium heat with a pinch of salt and cumin, 3-4 minutes

### Assemble Bowls

1. Divide cilantro-lime rice among serving bowls
1. Top with sliced carne asada (or chosen protein), black beans, and charred corn
1. Add pico de gallo, avocado/guacamole, pickled red onions, and pickled jalapeños
1. Garnish with fresh cilantro, drizzle with chipotle crema, and serve with lime wedges

## Notes

- **Traditional preparation:** Uses white rice, which cooks in 15-20 minutes and has a lighter, fluffier texture
- **Flavor/texture tradeoff with brown rice:** Brown rice is nuttier and chewier. The lime and cilantro keep it bright and fresh. For traditional texture, use white rice or a 50/50 blend
- **Steak tips:** Flank or skirt steak work best. Slice thinly against the grain for maximum tenderness. Don't overcook; medium-rare to medium is ideal
- **Quick version:** Use pre-marinated carne asada from the meat counter, or rotisserie chicken tossed with marinade spices
- **Make ahead:** Marinate protein up to 24 hours. Pickle onions up to 1 week ahead. Rice lasts 3-4 days refrigerated
- **Meal prep:** Store components separately. Rice and beans reheat well. Cook protein fresh or gently reheat to avoid toughness
- **Corn alternative:** Use canned corn, drain well, and char in a dry skillet. Frozen corn works great too
