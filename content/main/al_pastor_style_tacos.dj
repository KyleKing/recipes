### For Cooking and Serving

- [ ] 1/2 medium white onion, finely diced

## Recipe

### Prepare the Marinade

1. If using dried chiles: Remove stems and seeds, tear into pieces, and toast in a dry skillet over medium heat for 1-2 minutes until fragrant (do not burn). Soak in hot water for 15 minutes until softened
1. Add softened chiles (or chili powder), pineapple juice, vinegar, garlic, cumin, oregano, cinnamon, cloves, salt, pepper, and achiote paste to a blender. Blend until smooth

### Marinate the Protein

1. For pork or chicken: Place sliced meat in a bowl or zip-top bag, pour marinade over, and toss to coat. Marinate for at least 2 hours or overnight in refrigerator
1. For tofu: Press tofu to remove excess moisture, cut into cubes, and marinate for at least 1 hour (or up to 8 hours)
1. For beans: Toss beans with marinade and let sit for 30 minutes to 2 hours

### Cook

1. Heat oil in a large skillet or griddle over medium-high heat
1. For pork/chicken: Cook marinated meat in batches until edges are charred and meat is cooked through (6-8 minutes per batch). Remove and let rest, then chop into smaller pieces
1. For tofu: Cook cubes until edges are crispy and caramelized (8-10 minutes), turning occasionally
1. For beans: Cook beans with marinade over medium heat until liquid reduces and beans are slightly crispy on edges (8-10 minutes)
1. In the same pan, add diced pineapple and cook until caramelized and slightly charred (3-4 minutes)

### Assemble

1. Warm tortillas on a griddle or directly over a gas flame
1. Fill tortillas with cooked protein and caramelized pineapple
1. Top with diced onion, fresh cilantro, and a squeeze of lime
1. Serve with additional lime wedges and optional toppings

## Notes

- Traditional al pastor uses pork shoulder slow-cooked on a vertical spit (trompo) with pineapple on top, but this home version achieves similar flavors
- Achiote paste adds authentic red color and earthy flavor; find it in Mexican grocery stores or online
- For spicier tacos, add 1-2 chipotle peppers in adobo to the marinade
- Dried guajillo and ancho chiles provide the best flavor, but chili powder works as a substitute
- For extra char flavor, finish protein under the broiler for 2-3 minutes
- Leftover protein stores well in refrigerator for 3-4 days and reheats nicely
