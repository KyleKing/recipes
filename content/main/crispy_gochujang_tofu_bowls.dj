- [ ] 2 tablespoons water

### Bowl Components

- [ ] 4 cups mixed vegetables (bok choy, snap peas, carrots, edamame)
- [ ] 1 tablespoon neutral oil for stir-frying

- [ ] 4 green onions, thinly sliced
- [ ] 1 tablespoon toasted sesame seeds for garnish

## Recipe

### Marinate the Tofu

1. Press tofu for at least 30 minutes to remove excess moisture, then cut into 1-inch cubes
1. In a bowl or ziplock bag, whisk together sesame oil, vegetable oil, garlic, gochujang, soy sauce, brown sugar, sesame seeds, and water
1. Add tofu cubes and toss to coat. Refrigerate for minimum 30 minutes or up to overnight

### Cook the Rice

1. Rinse rice under cold water until water runs clear
1. Combine rice and water in a pot. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer 15 minutes for white rice or 40-45 minutes for brown rice
1. Remove from heat and let sit covered for 10 minutes, then fluff with a fork

### Crisp the Tofu

1. Heat oven to 425°F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper
1. Remove tofu from marinade (reserve marinade) and spread on baking sheet in a single layer
1. Roast for 25-30 minutes, flipping halfway through, until edges are crispy and caramelized
1. Alternatively, air fry at 400°F for 15-18 minutes, shaking basket halfway through

### Prepare Vegetables

1. Heat oil in a large skillet or wok over high heat
1. Add harder vegetables first (carrots, snap peas) and stir-fry for 2-3 minutes
1. Add softer vegetables (bok choy, edamame) and stir-fry another 2 minutes until tender-crisp
1. Season lightly with salt or splash of soy sauce

### Assemble Bowls

1. Divide rice among bowls
1. Arrange crispy tofu, stir-fried vegetables, kimchi, fresh spinach, and cucumber slices in sections
1. Top with fried egg if using
1. Drizzle with reserved marinade (thinned with a bit of water if needed)
1. Garnish with sliced green onions and sesame seeds

## Notes

- **Meal prep advantage**: Rice, tofu, and stir-fried vegetables can be prepared in advance and stored separately for 4-5 days. Assemble bowls fresh with kimchi, greens, and cucumber
- **Gochujang substitute**: 2 tsp miso paste + 1 tsp sriracha + 1/2 tsp sugar per 1 Tbsp gochujang. Flavor will differ from fermented original
- **Gochujang heat levels**: Start with 2 tablespoons for mild heat, increase to 3-4 for spicier. Gochujang varies by brand
- **Dark soy sauce substitute**: Regular soy sauce + 1/4 tsp molasses or brown sugar per 1 Tbsp dark soy
- **Lettuce wrap variation**: Serve crispy tofu in butter lettuce leaves with rice, kimchi, and vegetables for a hands-on meal
- **For extra crispiness**: Pat tofu very dry after pressing and toss with 1-2 tablespoons cornstarch before marinating
