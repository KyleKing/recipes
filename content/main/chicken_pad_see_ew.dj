## Ingredients

### Pad See Ew Sauce

- [ ] 25 g Dark soy sauce (1 part)
- [ ] 25 g Soy sauce (1 part)
- [ ] 25 g Oyster sauce (1 part)
- [ ] 25 g Sugar (1 part)
- [ ] 10 g Fish sauce (1/2 part)

### Base Stir Fry Ingredients

- [ ] 150 g Wide rice noodles
- [ ] Cooking oil, for stir frying
- [ ] 2 Eggs, beaten
- [ ] 3-4 cloves Garlic, thinly sliced
- [ ] White pepper, to taste
- [ ] 1 Chicken breast, thinly sliced (225 g)
- [ ] 1 bunch Broccolini, roughly chopped (200 g)

## Recipe

1. Prep the noodles and sauce by soaking noodles per package directions. Mix all sauce ingredients until combined; can be prepared ahead.
1. Stir fry eggs and vegetables by heating wok over high heat with oil. Swirl in beaten egg until fluffy; remove to bowl. Add oil, garlic, and pepper; bloom 30-45 seconds. Stir fry broccolini 1-2 minutes with sauce drizzle; set aside with eggs.
1. Brown the chicken by adding oil and chicken slices; brown 2 minutes each side. Season with sauce drizzle for color.
1. Bring it all together by returning broccolini and eggs to wok with drained noodles. Add sauce to coat. Stir fry 5-7 minutes until noodles soften and absorb sauce. Adjust texture with extra sauce or water if needed. Serve with white pepper.

## Notes

- Serves 2-3 in 45 minutes
- Soaking prevents noodles from stickiness during cooking
- Cook in stages to achieve proper browning without crowding the pan
- Taste and adjust seasonings before serving
