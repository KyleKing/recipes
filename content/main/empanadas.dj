## Ingredients

### Dough (Makes 12-14 empanadas)

- [ ] 3 cups all-purpose flour
- [ ] 1/2 teaspoon salt
- [ ] 3/4 cup vegetable oil (or use 10 tablespoons butter for flakier dough)
- [ ] 1/2 cup cold water
- [ ] 1 egg beaten with 2 tablespoons water (for egg wash)

### Traditional Beef Filling

- [ ] 2 tablespoons olive oil
- [ ] 1 large onion, finely chopped
- [ ] 3 cloves garlic, minced
- [ ] 1 pound ground beef (93/7 lean recommended)
- [ ] 2 teaspoons ground cumin
- [ ] 1 tablespoon sweet paprika
- [ ] 2 teaspoons dried oregano
- [ ] 1 teaspoon salt
- [ ] 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
- [ ] 1/2 cup green olives, sliced
- [ ] 2 hard-boiled eggs, chopped (optional but traditional)
- [ ] 1/2 cup fresh flat-leaf parsley, chopped
- [ ] 1 tablespoon fresh cilantro, chopped
- [ ] 2 green onions, sliced

## Recipe

### Make the Dough

1. In a large bowl, whisk together flour and salt
2. Add vegetable oil and cold water, mixing with a fork until combined
3. Use your hands to bring mixture together into a dough
4. Knead gently on a clean surface for 3-5 minutes until soft and pliable
5. Wrap dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes (up to 24 hours)

### Make the Filling

6. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat
7. Add onion and cook until softened, about 5 minutes
8. Add garlic and cook for 1 minute until fragrant
9. Add ground beef, cumin, paprika, oregano, salt, and pepper
10. Cook, breaking up meat with a spoon, until beef is no longer pink, about 8 minutes
11. Drain excess fat thoroughly (this prevents soggy empanadas)
12. Remove from heat and stir in olives, hard-boiled eggs if using, parsley, cilantro, and green onions
13. Let filling cool completely before assembling (can refrigerate up to 2 days)

### Assemble

14. Divide dough into 12-14 equal portions and roll each into a ball
15. On a lightly floured surface, roll each ball into a 5-6 inch circle, about 1/8 inch thick
16. Place 2-3 tablespoons filling in the center of each circle
17. Fold dough over to create a half-moon shape, pressing edges to seal
18. Crimp edges with a fork or make a decorative rope braid (repulgue) by folding and pinching
19. Place empanadas on parchment-lined baking sheets, spacing 1 inch apart
20. Brush tops with egg wash for golden color

### Bake

21. Preheat oven to 375°F
22. Bake for 20-25 minutes until golden brown
23. Let cool for 5 minutes before serving

### Air Fry (Alternative to Baking)

21. Preheat air fryer to 370°F
22. Lightly spray air fryer basket with cooking spray
23. Arrange empanadas in a single layer, not touching (work in batches)
24. Brush with egg wash
25. Air fry for 10-12 minutes, flipping halfway through, until golden brown

## Notes

- **Store-bought shortcut:** Use Goya empanada discs (found in freezer section) or pie dough instead of homemade dough
- **Make-ahead:** Assemble empanadas, freeze unbaked on a baking sheet, then transfer to freezer bags; bake from frozen, adding 5-10 minutes to baking time
- **Filling variations:**
  - **Chicken:** Substitute shredded rotisserie chicken for beef, add 1/4 cup chicken broth
  - **Cheese:** Use 2 cups shredded mozzarella mixed with 1/2 cup ricotta and fresh herbs
  - **Spinach & cheese:** Sauté 10 oz spinach with garlic, mix with ricotta and feta
  - **Sweet potato & black bean:** Roasted sweet potato cubes with black beans, cumin, and corn
- **Serving suggestions:** Serve with chimichurri sauce, salsa verde, or hot sauce for dipping
- Argentine empanadas traditionally include cumin in the beef filling, distinguishing them from other Latin American styles
- The dough can also be made with butter (10 tablespoons) instead of oil for a flakier, more pastry-like texture
- Proper sealing is critical - squeeze out air before crimping and crimp twice if needed
