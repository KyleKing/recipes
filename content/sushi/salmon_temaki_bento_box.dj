- [ ] 50 g edamame
- [ ] 3 seaweed handroll sheets (nori)

- [ ] 100 g water (2 parts)
- [ ] 50 g rice vinegar (1 part)
- [ ] 50 g white vinegar (1 part)
- [ ] Salt, a sprinkle
- [ ] MSG, a pinch

## Recipe

1. Prepare the sushi rice according to package directions and let cool
1. While rice is cooking, prepare the pickled vegetables:

  1. Combine water, rice vinegar, white vinegar, salt, and MSG in a bowl
  1. Add julienned carrots and sliced serrano peppers
  1. Let marinate for at least 15 minutes
1. Cook edamame according to package directions and season with salt
1. Prepare salmon:

  1. If using raw salmon for sashimi, ensure it is sushi-grade and thinly slice
  1. Alternatively, pan-sear or bake salmon (see [Salmon Baked with Asparagus](../seafood/salmon_baked_with_asparagus.html) for baking instructions) and let cool
1. Assemble the temaki (hand rolls):

  1. Place a sheet of nori on your palm, shiny side down
  1. Add a small amount of rice to the left third of the nori
  1. Top with salmon, pickled vegetables, and a drizzle of kewpie mayo and sriracha
  1. Roll from the bottom left corner to form a cone shape
1. Garnish with black sesame seeds
1. Serve with edamame on the side

## Notes

- Temaki are best eaten immediately after rolling to keep the nori crispy
- For a complete bento box, add other components like cucumber slices, avocado, or Japanese pickles
