## Pancakes || https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1893-everyday-pancakes

1. Mix dry ingredients in a bowl
2. Combine, eggs and 1.5 cups milk then stir in butter (melted and let cool)
3. Gently stir the liquid mix into the dry ingredient bowl {Mix only enough to moisten flour; don't worry about a few lumps. If batter seems thick, add a little more milk}
4. Spray a griddle or large skillet and heat over medium-low heat
5. Measure out â…“ cup of batter. Flip when bubbles begin to form on the edges (2-4 minutes), then lightly brown on the opposite side

My favorite mix-ins: oatmeal, chopped walnuts, peanut butter, flaxseed, banana, blueberry
