## Ingredients

### Chicken Broth

- [ ] 2-3 lbs chicken parts (backs, wings, necks, carcass from rotisserie chicken)
- [ ] 1 onion, quartered (no need to peel)
- [ ] 2 carrots, roughly chopped
- [ ] 2 celery stalks, roughly chopped
- [ ] 4 cloves garlic, smashed
- [ ] 2 bay leaves
- [ ] 1 tsp black peppercorns
- [ ] Fresh herbs (parsley, thyme, or rosemary)
- [ ] Water to fill (about 8-10 cups)
- [ ] 1 tbsp apple cider vinegar (helps extract minerals)

### Vegetable Broth

- [ ] 2 onions, quartered
- [ ] 3 carrots, roughly chopped
- [ ] 3 celery stalks, roughly chopped
- [ ] 8 oz mushrooms, halved
- [ ] 6 cloves garlic, smashed
- [ ] 2 bay leaves
- [ ] 1 tsp black peppercorns
- [ ] Fresh herbs (parsley, thyme)
- [ ] 2 tbsp tomato paste
- [ ] 2 tbsp soy sauce (adds umami)
- [ ] Water to fill (about 8-10 cups)

### Bone Broth

- [ ] 3-4 lbs beef bones (marrow bones, knuckles, oxtail) or chicken feet
- [ ] 1 onion, quartered
- [ ] 2 carrots, roughly chopped
- [ ] 2 celery stalks, roughly chopped
- [ ] 4 cloves garlic, smashed
- [ ] 2 bay leaves
- [ ] 1 tsp black peppercorns
- [ ] 2 tbsp apple cider vinegar (critical for extracting collagen)
- [ ] Fresh herbs
- [ ] Water to fill (about 8-10 cups)

## Recipe

1. Optional but recommended: Roast bones/vegetables at 400°F for 30-40 minutes until browned for deeper flavor
2. Add all ingredients to Instant Pot. Fill with water to max fill line (do not exceed)
3. Close lid, set valve to sealing
4. Cook on high pressure:
   - Chicken broth: 45 minutes
   - Vegetable broth: 30 minutes
   - Bone broth: 120 minutes (2 hours)
5. Natural release for 15-20 minutes, then quick release remaining pressure
6. Strain through fine mesh strainer or cheesecloth. Press solids to extract all liquid
7. Let cool, then refrigerate. Skim fat layer from top once chilled (save for cooking)
8. Store in refrigerator for up to 5 days, or freeze in portions for up to 6 months

## Notes

### What Makes Good Broth

- Rich color (deep golden for chicken, amber for bone broth)
- Gelatinous texture when cold (indicates collagen extraction)
- Clear, not cloudy (strain well, don't boil vigorously)
- Deep, savory flavor with good body
- Natural release prevents cloudiness

### What Makes Bad Broth

- Bitter taste (overcooked vegetables, especially cruciferous ones)
- Cloudy appearance (rolling boil instead of gentle simmer)
- Weak flavor (insufficient bones/aromatics or too much water)
- Thin, watery texture (not enough collagen from bones/cartilage)
- Off flavors (old ingredients, burnt vegetables)

### Tips

- Use cold water to start for clearer broth
- Don't add salt until using in final dish (allows for better seasoning control)
- Save vegetable scraps in freezer bag for broth (carrot peels, celery ends, onion skins, herb stems)
- Avoid cruciferous vegetables (broccoli, cabbage, Brussels sprouts) which make broth bitter
- For richer broth, reduce on sauté mode after straining
- Chicken feet add excellent gelatin for bone broth
- Apple cider vinegar is essential for extracting minerals and collagen from bones
- Freeze in ice cube trays or 1-2 cup portions for easy use

### Roasting for Deeper Flavor

- Roasting bones and vegetables before pressure cooking adds depth
- Spread on sheet pan, roast at 400°F for 30-40 minutes until well browned
- Especially beneficial for bone broth and darker chicken stocks
- Deglaze roasting pan with water and add to Instant Pot
