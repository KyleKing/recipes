## Recipe

1. Heat olive oil in large pot over medium heat. Add onion and cook until softened, 5-7 minutes

1. Add broth and bring to boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer 20-25 minutes until all vegetables are very tender
1. If using spinach or kale, add during last 5 minutes of cooking
1. Remove from heat and let cool slightly, about 5 minutes

1. Taste and adjust seasoning as needed. Add pinch of sugar if sauce is too acidic
1. Serve over pasta with parmesan cheese if desired

## Notes

- **Freezer-friendly**: Freeze in portions (2-cup containers or ice cube trays) for up to 3 months. Thaw overnight in fridge or microwave from frozen
- **Vegetable variations**: Swap or add butternut squash, sweet potato, mushrooms, or celery. Keep total vegetable amount the same (about 5 cups chopped)
- **Protein additions**: Stir in cooked ground turkey, chicken, or plant-based crumbles after blending
- **Texture preference**: For chunkier sauce, blend only half or pulse briefly instead of fully smooth
- **Flavor boosters**: Add 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes for adults, fresh basil at end, or splash of balsamic vinegar
- **Storage**: Refrigerate in airtight container up to 5 days
- **Serving ideas**: Use with any pasta shape, in lasagna, as pizza sauce, or in baked ziti
- **Kid involvement**: Let kids help add ingredients to pot (supervised) and press blender button
- **Make ahead**: Sauce actually tastes better next day as flavors meld
- **Batch cooking**: Double or triple recipe for meal prep
