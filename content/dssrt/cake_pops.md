1) Bake a cake according to the instructions and let cool.
2) Crumble the cake into a large mixing bowl and combine with the frosting. Roll 1" balls onto a parchment-lined baking sheet.
3) Put the chocolate morsels into a microwaveable bowl. Microwave on HIGH for 30 second intervals and stir in between (~2 minutes).
4) Drop the Cake Pop balls into the melted chocolate, then carefully lift out with two forks to let the excess chocolate drip off and return to the baking pan.
5) Refrigerate or freeze until firm.
