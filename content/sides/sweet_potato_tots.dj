## Ingredients

- [ ] 2 medium sweet potatoes (about 1 lb)
- [ ] 1/2 cup shredded cheddar cheese
- [ ] 1/4 cup all-purpose flour or almond flour
- [ ] 1 large egg
- [ ] 1/4 tsp garlic powder
- [ ] 1/4 tsp onion powder
- [ ] 1/4 tsp salt
- [ ] 1/8 tsp black pepper
- [ ] Cooking spray or olive oil
- [ ] (optional) ~1/4 cup panko or bread crumbs

## Recipe

1. Poke sweet potatoes with fork several times. Microwave on high 8-10 minutes, flipping halfway, until very soft. Let cool 5 minutes
1. Scoop flesh from skins into large bowl. Mash until smooth and let cool to room temperature
1. Preheat the oven (400F) or airfrier (375F), then prepare the appropriate tray by spraying lightly with oil or using parchment paper for baking
1. Add cheese, flour, egg, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper. Mix until well combined
1. Scoop 1 Tbsp of mixture and shape into small cylinder (tot shape). If using, for extra crispy exterior, roll the formed tots in breadcrumbs or panko. Place onto the prpared cooking surface

    1. Repeat with remaining mixture, spacing tots 1 inch apart
1. Bake

    - For airfrying, cook at 375°F for 12-15 minutes; shake to rotate the tops halfway through
    - For the oven, bake 15 minutes, carefully flip each tot, then bake another 15-20 minutes until golden brown and crispy
1. Cool 5 minutes before serving. Serve with ketchup or ranch for dipping

## Notes

- **Freezer-friendly**: Freeze unbaked tots on baking sheet until solid, then transfer to freezer bag for up to 3 months. Bake from frozen at 400°F for 30-35 minutes, flipping halfway
- **Add vegetables**: Mix in finely chopped spinach, grated carrot, or cauliflower rice
- **Binding issues**: If mixture is too wet to form, add more flour 1 Tbsp at a time
- **Make ahead**: Formed tots can be refrigerated for up to 24 hours before baking
- **Serving suggestions**: Great alongside burgers, sandwiches, or as healthy snack
