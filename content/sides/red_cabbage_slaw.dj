## Ingredients

- [ ] 1/2 head Red Cabbage, thinly sliced (about 4-5 cups)
- [ ] 1 large Carrot, grated
- [ ] 2 Green Onions, thinly sliced
- [ ] 3 Tbsp Apple Cider Vinegar
- [ ] 2 Tbsp Olive Oil
- [ ] 1 Tbsp Honey or Maple Syrup
- [ ] 1/2 tsp Salt
- [ ] 1/4 tsp Black Pepper
- [ ] (Optional) 1/4 cup Cilantro or Parsley, chopped
- [ ] (Optional) 2 Tbsp Sunflower Seeds or Sliced Almonds

## Recipe

1. Thinly slice the red cabbage, grate the carrot, and slice the green onions. Place in a large bowl
1. In a small bowl, whisk together the apple cider vinegar, olive oil, honey, salt, and pepper
1. Pour the dressing over the cabbage mixture and toss well to coat
1. Let sit for at least 10 minutes to allow the cabbage to soften slightly and the flavors to meld
1. Add optional cilantro and seeds just before serving
1. Serve immediately or refrigerate for up to 3 days (flavors improve over time)

## Notes

- The acid in the vinegar will turn the cabbage a bright pink/magenta color
- Great as a topping for tacos, sandwiches, or grain bowls
- For a creamier version, add 2-3 Tbsp of Greek yogurt or mayonnaise
- Can substitute white vinegar or rice vinegar for apple cider vinegar
