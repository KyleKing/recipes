- [ ] 3 cloves Garlic, minced
- [ ] 1 Tbsp Fresh Ginger, grated
- [ ] 8 oz Oyster Mushrooms, torn into strips
- [ ] 1/2 head Red Cabbage, thinly sliced (about 4-5 cups)
- [ ] 8 oz Firm Tofu, pressed and cubed (optional)
- [ ] 3 Tbsp Soy Sauce or Tamari
- [ ] 2 Tbsp Rice Vinegar
- [ ] 1 Tbsp Brown Sugar or Maple Syrup
- [ ] 1 tsp Sesame Oil
- [ ] 1/4 tsp Red Pepper Flakes (optional)
- [ ] 2 Green Onions, thinly sliced
- [ ] 1 Tbsp Sesame Seeds for garnish

## Recipe

1. If using tofu, press it for 15 minutes, then cube and pat dry
1. Heat 1 Tbsp oil in a large skillet or wok over high heat
1. If using tofu, add it and cook 3-4 minutes per side until golden. Transfer to a plate
1. Add remaining 1 Tbsp oil to the skillet
1. Add sliced shallots and cook 2-3 minutes until softened and lightly caramelized
1. Add garlic and ginger, cook 30 seconds until fragrant
1. Add oyster mushrooms and cook 4-5 minutes without stirring initially to get a good sear, then toss occasionally until golden
1. Add sliced red cabbage and stir-fry for 5-7 minutes until cabbage is tender but still has some bite
1. In a small bowl, whisk together soy sauce, rice vinegar, brown sugar, sesame oil, and red pepper flakes
1. Pour sauce over the vegetables and toss to coat
1. Add tofu back to the skillet if using, and toss everything together
1. Cook for 1-2 minutes until sauce is absorbed and everything is heated through
1. Remove from heat and garnish with green onions and sesame seeds
1. Serve immediately over rice or vermicelli noodles, or enjoy as a side dish

## Notes

- Tear oyster mushrooms by hand along their natural grain for the best texture
- Can substitute shiitake, cremini, or king oyster mushrooms
- High heat is key for a good stir-fry - don't overcrowd the pan
- For extra protein without tofu, add edamame or cooked chicken
- Red cabbage will turn a vibrant purple-blue color when cooked
- Leftovers can be refrigerated for 3-4 days and reheated
