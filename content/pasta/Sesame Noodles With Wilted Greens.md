## Sesame Noodles With Wilted Greens || https://www.budgetbytes.com/2016/05/sesame-noodles-wilted-greens/

- 8 oz Spaghetti
- 1/2 bag of spinach (4 oz)
- 2 eggs
- olive oil
- 2 minced cloves garlic
- 1/4 cup soy sauce
- 1 tbsp toasted sesame oil
- 1/3 tbsp cider vinegar (or 1/2 Tbsp rice vinegar)
- 1 tbsp sesame seeds
- 1/2 tbsp red pepper flakes
end

1. Combine soy sauce, sesame oil, cider vinegar, sesame seeds, red pepper flakes, and half of the garlic in a small bowl then set aside {start a large pot of water to boil}
2. In a large skillet over medium heat, sauté the other half of the garlic in olive oil (about 1 min). Then add the spinach and sauté until wilted (the spinach should still be bright green and look slightly plump). Season with salt and pepper and remove from heat.
3. Once boiling, cook the pasta, drain, then with the heat off, mix the sauce and pasta. Keep the lid on to keep the pot warm
4. Prepare the eggs however you like (fried sunny side up, over hard, poached, scrambled, or soft boiled), then combine and serve!
