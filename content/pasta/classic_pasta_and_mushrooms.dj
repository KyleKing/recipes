## Ingredients

- [ ] 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling
- [ ] 1.5 lb mixed fresh mushrooms (shiitake, oyster and/or cremini); rinsed, trimmed, and sliced
- [ ] 2 Tbsp unsalted butter
- [ ] 1/2 tsp kosher salt, plus more as needed
- [ ] 3 cloves garlic, minced
- [ ] 2 tsp chopped fresh rosemary leaves
- [ ] 1/3 tsp crushed red pepper flakes
- [ ] 1 cup no-salt-added vegetable broth (or water)
- [ ] 1 lb penne or 12 oz egg noodles
- [ ] 1/4 cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
- [ ] 1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese, plus more for serving
- [ ] black pepper, for serving
- [ ] peas (optional)

## Recipe

1. Wash the mushrooms in a large bowl of water then dry in a colander

  1. Trim the base to have a stable surface for slicing vertically. Set aside in a large bowl
1. Grate the cheese and prepare the rosemary and garlic cloves, but hold off on chopping until the mushrooms are caramelizing
1. Bring a large pot of water to boil
1. While the water is heating, in a large skillet over medium-high heat, heat the olive oil until shimmering

  1. Add about half the mushrooms and cook, stirring, until they begin to wilt and make space in the pan; then add the remaining mushrooms
  1. Cook, stirring often, until they give up their liquid; then increase the heat to boil the liquid away and caramelize the mushrooms (8-10 min)
1. Reduce the heat to medium, add the butter and let it melt

  1. Stir in the garlic, rosemary, salt, and red pepper flakes until fragrant (30s)
1. Meanwhile, add the pasta to the water and cook 1-2 min less than the package directions
1. Add the vegetable broth and simmer until reduced by half, about 3 minutes

  1. Reduce the heat to its lowest setting and cover to keep warm.
1. When the pasta is ready, transfer to the pan with tongs

  1. Drizzle with olive oil, sprinkle with the parsley and toss to coat
  1. Add a little reserved pasta water if the pan seems dry
1. Remove the skillet from the heat, and sprinkle with the grated cheese

  1. Toss and serve hot, passing more grated cheese at the table and fresh black pepper
