## Ingredients

### Tomato Base

- [ ] 1.5 lbs cherry tomatoes, halved
- [ ] 1/2 medium onion, finely diced
- [ ] 3 cloves garlic, minced
- [ ] 2 Tbsp olive oil
- [ ] 1/2 tsp dried oregano
- [ ] 1/2 tsp dried basil
- [ ] 1/4 tsp salt
- [ ] freshly cracked pepper
- [ ] 1 tsp balsamic or red wine vinegar
- [ ] 1 tsp Dijon mustard
- [ ] 1/2 Tbsp lemon juice
- [ ] pinch of sugar (optional, balances acidity)
- [ ] 1 Tbsp capers, drained (optional)
- [ ] 1 (15 oz) can chickpeas, drained and rinsed (optional)

### Fish & Topping

- [ ] 1 lb. white fish (four 4 oz fillets)
- [ ] 1/2 cup panko breadcrumbs
- [ ] 1 Tbsp olive oil (for topping)
- [ ] zest of 1/2 lemon
- [ ] 2 Tbsp fresh herbs (basil, thyme, or chives), chopped

## Recipe

1. Preheat the oven to 400F
1. Roast cherry tomatoes on a baking sheet for 15 minutes at 400F
1. Heat 2 Tbsp olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add onion and cook until softened, 3-4 minutes. Add garlic and cook 1 minute until fragrant
1. Add roasted tomatoes, oregano, basil, salt, pepper, vinegar, mustard, lemon juice, and sugar if using. Simmer 2-3 minutes to meld flavors. Stir in capers and chickpeas if using. Remove from heat
1. **For crispy topping - choose one method:**

   - **Method 1 (pre-toasted):** In same skillet, toast panko in 1 Tbsp olive oil over medium heat, stirring constantly, until golden brown (3-4 minutes). Transfer to bowl and mix with lemon zest and herbs
   - **Method 2 (simpler):** Mix panko with 1 Tbsp olive oil, lemon zest, and herbs in a bowl
1. Spread about 1/3 of the tomato mixture in the bottom of a casserole dish big enough to fit all fillets without overlapping. Lay fish fillets over tomato mixture, then spoon remaining tomatoes over top
1. Sprinkle breadcrumb mixture evenly over each fillet
1. Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until fish reaches 145F internal temperature and flakes easily. If topping isn't golden, broil for 1-2 minutes watching carefully
1. Serve hot with lemon wedges and extra fresh herbs

## Notes

- **Canned tomato alternative:** Use 1 (15 oz) can diced tomatoes, drained (reserve 2 Tbsp liquid). Skip roasting step, add drained tomatoes plus reserved liquid to sautéed onions and garlic
- **Wine substitute:** Replace vinegar with 2 Tbsp white wine or dry vermouth for more depth
- **Fish options:** Cod, tilapia, halibut, or snapper work well
- **Make ahead:** Prepare tomato base up to 1 day ahead; assemble and add topping just before baking
- **Chickpeas:** If adding, they integrate into the tomato base for extra heartiness. Can also roast separately (400F for 20-25 min) with olive oil and herbs as a side
- **Serving suggestions:**

  - Asparagus: Air fry at 400F for 8-10 minutes with olive oil, salt, pepper, and grated parmesan
  - Couscous: Cook with butter/olive oil and lemon zest, stir in parmesan and fresh herbs
  - Crusty bread for soaking up tomato sauce
  - Rice pilaf or roasted potatoes with herbs
