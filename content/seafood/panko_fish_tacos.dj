## Ingredients

- [ ] 454g white fish of choice
- [ ] Salt (a sprinkle, plus more for finishing)
- [ ] 80g flour
- [ ] 40g cornstarch
- [ ] 2 eggs (beaten)
- [ ] 100g panko bread crumbs
- [ ] Neutral oil (as needed for frying)
- [ ] 1 lime (for zest and juice)
- [ ] 6-8 corn tortillas
- [ ] Pickled onions (as needed)
- [ ] Hot sauce (as needed)
- [ ] Kewpie mayo (as needed)
- [ ] Cilantro (as needed)
- [ ] Limes (as needed for serving)

## Recipe

1. Remove any bones from the fish and slice into large sticks matching your tortilla size. Sprinkle salt evenly over pieces. Optionally, refrigerate for an hour or overnight.
1. Heat oil in a wok or dutch oven over medium heat (about 2 inches deep). Prepare three trays with flour-cornstarch mixture, beaten egg, and panko crumbs separately. Coat fish in flour mixture, dip in egg, then roll in panko, pressing to adhere.
1. Heat oil to 350°F (176°C). Gently place fish in oil and fry in batches for 4-6 minutes total, agitating occasionally. Avoid overcrowding.
1. Transfer fried fish to paper towel-lined rack. Dab excess oil, then sprinkle with salt, lime zest, and juice. Serve on warm tortillas with toppings like hot sauce, cilantro, pickled onions, mayo, or slaw.

## Notes

- Creator Ethan Chlebowski recommends this tonkatsu-style breading over traditional batter for better texture with fresh toppings
