## Recipe

1. Remove any bones from the fish and slice into large sticks matching your tortilla size. Pat fish completely dry with paper towels. Sprinkle salt evenly over pieces. Optionally, refrigerate for an hour or overnight.
1. Prepare three trays with flour-cornstarch mixture, beaten egg, and panko crumbs separately. Coat fish in flour mixture, dip in egg, then roll in panko, pressing gently to adhere.
1. **For deep frying**: Heat oil (about 2 inches deep) in a wok or dutch oven to 350°F (176°C). Gently place fish in oil and fry in batches for 4-6 minutes total, agitating occasionally. Avoid overcrowding. **For air frying**: Preheat air fryer to 400°F (204°C). Place breaded fish in a single layer in basket, spray lightly with cooking oil. Cook 10-12 minutes without flipping (or flip halfway for extra even browning). Avoid overcrowding.
1. Transfer cooked fish to paper towel-lined rack (if fried) or plate. Sprinkle with salt, lime zest, and juice. Serve on warm tortillas with your choice of toppings.

## Notes

- Creator Ethan Chlebowski recommends this tonkatsu-style breading over traditional batter for better texture with fresh toppings
- Cod is suggested as a mild white fish option
- Air frying reduces oil significantly while maintaining crispy panko texture - key is patting fish dry and using cooking spray
- Serves 6-8
- Total time: 45 minutes (deep frying) or 30 minutes (air frying)
