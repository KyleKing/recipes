## Ingredients

### Fish

- [ ] 4 (5- to 6-ounce) skinless tilapia fillets
- [ ] 1 tsp kosher salt
- [ ] 2 Tbsp extra-virgin olive oil

### Chimichurri

- [ ] 2 Tbsp hot water
- [ ] 2 Tbsp red wine vinegar
- [ ] 1 tsp dried oregano
- [ ] 1/2 cup minced fresh parsley
- [ ] 1/4 cup minced fresh cilantro
- [ ] 3 garlic cloves, minced
- [ ] 1 tsp kosher salt
- [ ] 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes
- [ ] 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil

## Recipe

1. Place tilapia on cutting board and sprinkle both sides with salt. Allow to sit at room temperature for 15 minutes
1. While tilapia rests, combine hot water, vinegar, and oregano in medium bowl and let stand for 5 minutes to soften oregano and release flavor
1. Add parsley, cilantro, garlic, salt, and pepper flakes to oregano mixture and stir to combine. Whisk in 1/4 cup oil until incorporated. Set aside
1. Pat tilapia dry with paper towels. Using seam running down middle of fillet as guide, cut each fillet in half lengthwise to create 1 thick half and 1 thin half
1. Heat 2 Tbsp oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over high heat until just smoking. Add thick halves of fillets to skillet. Cook, tilting and gently shaking skillet occasionally to distribute oil, until undersides are golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes
1. Using thin spatula, flip fillets. Cook until second sides are golden brown and tilapia registers 130-135F, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer tilapia to serving platter
1. Return skillet to high heat. When oil is just smoking, add thin halves of fillets and cook until undersides are golden brown, about 1 minute
1. Flip and cook until second sides are golden brown, about 1 minute. Transfer to serving platter
1. Top fillets with 1/4 cup chimichurri and serve, passing remaining chimichurri separately

## Notes

- **Basic variation:** Omit chimichurri entirely and serve with lemon wedges for a simple preparation that highlights the fish
- Fresh or frozen tilapia works well. Thaw frozen fish completely before cooking
- No temperature check needed for thin fillet halves - they cook through when golden brown on both sides
- Soaking dried oregano in warm water and vinegar softens it and releases its flavor more effectively
- **Fish substitutions:** Cod, halibut, snapper, or other mild white fish work with this technique
