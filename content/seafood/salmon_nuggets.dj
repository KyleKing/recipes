## Ingredients

- [ ] 1 pound salmon (fresh or thawed frozen, skin removed)
- [ ] 1/3 cup all-purpose flour
- [ ] 2 large eggs, lightly beaten
- [ ] 1 1/4 cups panko bread crumbs (plain or seasoned)
- [ ] 1/2 teaspoon salt

### Optional Seasoning

- [ ] 1/2 teaspoon dried parsley
- [ ] 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
- [ ] 1/4 teaspoon paprika
- [ ] 1/4 teaspoon black pepper

## Recipe

1. Preheat oven to 425°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or spray with cooking spray
1. Use kitchen scissors to cut salmon into 2-inch squares (about 1-inch thick)
1. Set up three shallow bowls: one with flour, one with beaten eggs, and one with panko (mixed with salt and any optional seasonings)
1. Coat each salmon piece: dip in flour (shake off excess), then egg (let excess drip), then panko (press gently to adhere). Place on prepared baking sheet
1. Bake for 12-14 minutes until lightly golden and cooked through (internal temperature 145°F)
1. Serve immediately with lemon wedges, ketchup, tartar sauce, or your favorite dipping sauce

## Notes

- Using kitchen shears makes cutting the salmon much easier than a knife
- Panko creates a crispier coating than regular bread crumbs
- Store leftovers in an airtight container up to 3 days
- Reheat at 375°F for 4-6 minutes on a parchment-lined baking sheet (avoid microwave to maintain crispiness)
- These freeze well after cooking. Freeze in a single layer on a baking sheet, then transfer to a freezer bag for up to 3 months
- Pairs well with roasted potatoes, sweet potato fries, or a simple green salad
