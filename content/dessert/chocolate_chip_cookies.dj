1. The secrets to a fluffy cookie:

  1. Aerate when creaming the butter and sugar
  1. Ensure that the leavening agent is not expired
  1. Beat the eggs separately, then evenly incorporate
  1. Over-mixing when adding the dry ingredients can form gluten
  1. Chill the dough for at least an hour or overnight to solidify the fats and minimize spreading when baking
  1. Bake at a slightly higher 375F for a shorter time to have a quick rise that can avoid flat and dense cookies
