## Recipe

1. Close lid and cook on high pressure for 30 minutes
1. Allow natural pressure release (about 10-15 minutes)
1. Open lid and remove bay leaves; use back of spoon to gently mash some of the dal to create creamy texture while leaving most lentils intact
1. Set Instant Pot to sauté mode and add ghee
1. Add cumin seeds and let sizzle for 30 seconds
1. Add onion (if using) and cook until softened, about 3-4 minutes
1. Stir in tomato paste, turmeric, coriander, cumin, garam masala, cayenne, and salt; cook for 1 minute
1. Add this tempering mixture to the cooked dal and stir well
1. Stir in Greek yogurt and half-and-half until well combined
1. Simmer for 5-10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until dal reaches desired consistency
1. Turn off heat and stir in final garam masala
1. Serve garnished with fresh cilantro, alongside rice or naan

## Notes

- Serves 4
- Total time: 60 minutes (10 min prep + 50 min cook/release)
- Whole black urad dal (also called black gram or whole black lentils) can be found in Indian grocery stores or online; do not substitute with split urad dal
- Traditional dal makhani is slow-cooked for hours; Instant Pot version is much faster while maintaining authentic flavors
- For thinner consistency, add more water or cream; for thicker, simmer longer
- Vegetarian and high in plant-based protein
- Nutrition per serving: 156 calories, 16g carbs, 8g protein, 6g fat
- Can be made vegan by using coconut oil instead of ghee and coconut yogurt/milk instead of dairy
- Dal makhani literally means "buttery lentils" - don't skip the ghee/butter for authentic flavor
- Tastes even better the next day after flavors have melded

### Comparison to Other Lentil Recipes

- **vs [Red Lentil Dahl](red_lentil_dahl.html):** More complex with tempering done mid-cooking + tomato paste for umami vs dahl's simpler end-tempering; black lentils (firmer, earthier) vs red (creamy, nutty); enriched with yogurt/cream vs lighter finish
- **vs [Slow Cooker Lentil Curry](slow_cooker_lentil_curry.html):** More authentic technique (cumin seed tempering, specialty lentils) vs practical simplified approach; creamy and rich (yogurt/cream) vs chunky vegetable-loaded
- **Recipe philosophy:** Most authentic and technique-focused lentil recipe in the collection; uses traditional tempering, specialty ingredients (black urad dal, tomato paste), and dairy enrichment
