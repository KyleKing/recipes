      - [ ] 2 tsp ground turmeric
      - [ ] 1 tsp cumin powder
      - [ ] 1/2 tsp coriander powder
      - [ ] 1/2 tsp paprika
      - [ ] 1/2 tsp red chili powder

## Recipe

1. Heat oil in the Instant Pot over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic, saute until softened
1. Add the tomato paste and ginger, cook for 1 minute
1. Add the ground spices and cook for an additional minute until fragrant
1. Add the salt, lentils, tomatoes, and broth. Stir to combine
1. Slow cook for 7.5 hours
1. Stir in the peas and chickpeas. Start the rice
1. In the last 5 minutes, add the spinach and let wilt
1. Serve with citrus juice, a drizzle of tahini or Greek yogurt, and cilantro

## Notes

- Brown lentils maintain firm texture and add peppery flavor that stands up to the bold curry spices; red lentils would cook faster but break down into a mushier consistency
- Tomato paste adds concentrated umami depth that enriches the sauce without requiring tempering
- Fresh ginger provides brightness and aromatic punch that balances the rich spices
- Tahini or Greek yogurt drizzled at serving provides creaminess and tang without overpowering the curry flavors
- This simplified technique (sauté → bloom paste/ginger → bloom spices) builds complex flavor without special ingredients or steps

### Comparison to Other Lentil Recipes

- **vs [Red Lentil Dahl](red_lentil_dahl.html):** This curry is heartier and vegetable-loaded (spinach, peas, chickpeas) vs dahl's pure lentil focus; uses brown lentils (firm) vs red (creamy); tomato-based vs water-based; simplified technique vs traditional tempering
- **vs [Lentil Soup](lentil_soup.html):** Both use brown lentils and similar spices, but curry has bolder Indian flavors (garam masala, ginger, tomato paste) vs soup's lighter Mediterranean style; curry is thicker and more complex vs soup's brothier simplicity; slow cooker (7.5 hrs) vs Instant Pot (10 min)
- **Choose this when:** You want a chunky, richly-spiced curry with slow cooker convenience and complex flavor without tempering steps
