- [ ] 1/2 tsp ground turmeric
- [ ] 1/2 tsp salt

### Tempering (Tadka)

- [ ] 2 Tbsp ghee or oil
- [ ] 1 tsp cumin seeds
- [ ] 1 tsp mustard seeds
- [ ] 3 cloves garlic, minced
- [ ] 1 small onion, finely diced
- [ ] 1 tsp grated fresh ginger

## Recipe

1. Combine red lentils, water, turmeric, and salt in a pot
1. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 15-20 minutes until lentils break down into a creamy consistency, stirring occasionally
1. While lentils cook, prepare the tempering: heat ghee in a small pan over medium heat
1. Add cumin and mustard seeds, cook until they start to pop (30 seconds)
1. Add onion and cook until softened and golden (5-7 minutes)
1. Add garlic and ginger, cook for 1 minute
1. Add coriander, garam masala, and chili powder, cook for 30 seconds
1. Pour the tempering mixture into the cooked lentils and stir to combine
1. Serve garnished with cilantro and lime wedges, alongside rice or naan

## Notes

- Red lentils are ideal for dahl because they cook quickly (15-20 min) and naturally break down into a creamy, velvety texture without any blending
- The nutty flavor of red lentils pairs perfectly with aromatic Indian spices
- For thicker dahl, simmer longer or use less water; for thinner consistency, add water after cooking
- The tempering (tadka) adds crucial flavor depth; don't skip this step
- Can be made in Instant Pot: pressure cook lentils for 6 minutes, then quick release and add tempering

### Comparison to Other Lentil Recipes

- **vs [Slow Cooker Lentil Curry](slow_cooker_lentil_curry.html):** Dahl is a pure, creamy lentil dish vs curry's chunky vegetable stew; uses traditional tempering technique (bloomed seeds poured on top) vs simplified sauté method; water-based vs tomato-based; red lentils (creamy) vs brown (firm)
- **vs [Lentil Soup](lentil_soup.html):** Dahl has creamy texture from red lentils breaking down vs soup's firm lentils; Indian tempering technique vs straightforward sauté; richer, more concentrated vs lighter, brothier
