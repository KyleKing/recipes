## Recipe

### Make the Broth

1. Preheat broiler and line a baking sheet with foil. Place onion quarters and ginger halves (cut-side up) on sheet. Broil for 10-15 minutes until charred and blackened. Alternatively, char directly over a gas flame or in a dry skillet.

2. While vegetables char, toast whole spices (star anise, cloves, cinnamon sticks, coriander seeds, fennel seeds) in a large stockpot over medium heat for 2-3 minutes until fragrant, shaking pan occasionally. If using ground spices, skip this step and add them in step 3.

3. Add water, charred onion and ginger, dried shiitake mushrooms, kombu (if using), carrot, daikon, apple or pear, and ground spices (if using) to the stockpot. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer uncovered for 1-2 hours. Remove apple/pear after 45 minutes to prevent it from dissolving.

4. Strain broth through a fine-mesh sieve into a large bowl, pressing on solids to extract all liquid. Discard solids (or reserve mushrooms for serving). Return broth to pot.

5. Season broth with tamari, vegan fish sauce, sugar, and mushroom powder (if using). Taste and adjust seasoning - the broth should be aromatic, slightly sweet, and well-salted. Keep warm over low heat.

### Make the Crispy Tofu

1. Pat pressed tofu cubes very dry with paper towels. Toss with cornstarch until evenly coated.

2. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add tofu in a single layer (work in batches if needed). Cook undisturbed for 3-4 minutes until golden brown on bottom.

3. Flip tofu pieces and cook another 3-4 minutes until all sides are crispy and golden.

4. In a small bowl, whisk together soy sauce, sriracha (if using), and maple syrup. Pour over crispy tofu and toss to coat. Cook 1 more minute until sauce is absorbed. Transfer to a plate.

### Prepare the Vegetables

1. Heat oil in the same skillet over high heat. Add sliced mushrooms and a pinch of salt. Cook without stirring for 3-4 minutes until browned on one side, then toss and cook another 2 minutes.

2. Add bok choy wedges to the skillet, nestling them between mushrooms. Cook 1 minute, then add rice vinegar. Cover, reduce heat to medium, and cook 5-7 minutes until bok choy is tender. Add a splash of water if pan gets too dry.

### Cook Noodles and Assemble

1. Cook rice noodles according to package directions (usually 5-7 minutes in boiling water). Drain and rinse with cold water to prevent sticking.

2. Divide noodles among 4 deep bowls. Top each with crispy tofu, sautéed mushrooms, and bok choy.

3. Ladle hot broth over each bowl (the broth should be very hot to warm the noodles).

4. Top with bean sprouts, jalapeño slices, Thai basil, cilantro, and green onions. Serve immediately with lime wedges, hoisin sauce, and sriracha on the side.

## Notes

- **Spice substitutions**: If you can't find whole spices, use ground spices but add them directly to the broth (not toasted) and strain them out at the end. Whole spices provide better flavor.
- **Vegan fish sauce**: Brands like Red Boat make a vegan version, or find at Asian markets. In a pinch, use extra soy sauce plus rice vinegar, though the flavor won't be as complex.
- **Kombu**: This seaweed adds deep umami flavor. Find it at Asian markets, health food stores, or online. Can omit if unavailable.
- **Daikon radish**: Look for this large white radish at Asian markets. Regular radishes, turnips, or kohlrabi work as substitutes.
- **Make ahead**: Broth can be made 3-5 days ahead and refrigerated, or frozen for up to 3 months. Reheat before serving.
- **Customization**: Add other vegetables like snap peas, sliced carrots, or cabbage. Some recipes add a cinnamon stick or cardamom pods for extra warmth.
- **Authentic touch**: For more authentic flavor, increase simmering time to 3-4 hours for a deeper, more complex broth.
