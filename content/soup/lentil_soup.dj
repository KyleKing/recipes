- [ ] 3 cloves of garlic, chopped
- [ ] 1.5 cups dried green or brown lentils, _rinsed_
- [ ] 7 cups vegetable broth
- [ ] 8 oz tomato sauce
- [ ] 1 Tbsp ground cumin
- [ ] 1.5 tsp ground coriander
- [ ] 1/2 tsp ground turmeric
- [ ] 1 bay leaf
- [ ] 1 tsp salt
- [ ] 1/2 tsp ground black pepper

### Added Last

- [ ] 8 oz baby spinach
- [ ] Parmesan, for serving
- [ ] Crusty bread, for serving

## Recipe

1. In an Instant Pot, combine the ingredients
1. Select high pressure for 10 minutes
1. Quick release and remove the bay leaf
1. Stir in the spinach and let wilt
1. Serve the soup with grated Parmesan, fresh black pepper, and side of bread

## Notes

- Optional: Finish with a squeeze of lime or lemon juice for brightness
- Optional: Drizzle with olive oil before serving
- Green or brown lentils hold their shape well; red lentils will create a creamier texture but break down more
- Can substitute spinach with chard, kale, or other greens
