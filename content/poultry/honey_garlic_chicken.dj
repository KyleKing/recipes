## Ingredients

- [ ] 2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil (or canola oil)
- [ ] 1½ pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into ½-inch cubes
- [ ] Salt and black pepper
- [ ] 3 tablespoons honey
- [ ] 3 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce
- [ ] 3 cloves garlic, minced
- [ ] ¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional, omit for young kids)

### For Serving

- [ ] Steamed brown or white rice
- [ ] Green onions, sliced
- [ ] Sesame seeds
- [ ] Peanuts
- [ ] Lime wedges

## Recipe

1. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat
1. Season cubed chicken lightly with salt and pepper (go light on salt since soy sauce adds sodium)
1. Add chicken to hot skillet and cook without stirring for 3-4 minutes to brown one side
1. While chicken browns, whisk together honey, soy sauce, minced garlic, and red pepper flakes (if using) in a small bowl
1. Flip chicken pieces and immediately add the honey garlic sauce to the pan
1. Toss chicken to coat evenly in sauce and cook 4-5 more minutes until chicken is fully cooked through (internal temperature 165°F)
1. Serve immediately over steamed rice with desired toppings

## Notes

- The small chicken pieces cook quickly, so be careful not to overcook them or they'll become dry
- For a thicker sauce, mix 1-3 teaspoons cornstarch with 1 tablespoon water and add in the final 1-2 minutes of cooking
- Many cooks recommend doubling the sauce for a more generous coating on rice and vegetables
- The sweet-savory glaze makes this particularly appealing to children, even picky eaters
- Total cook time is genuinely 15 minutes, making this perfect for busy weeknights
- Pairs well with steamed broccoli, snap peas, or stir-fried vegetables
- Store leftovers in an airtight container for up to 3 days. Reheats well in the microwave
