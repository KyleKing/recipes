## Recipe

### Marinate the Chicken

1. In a large bowl, combine yogurt, lemon juice, garlic, ginger, garam masala, cumin, coriander, paprika, turmeric, cayenne, and salt
1. Add chicken pieces and toss to coat thoroughly
1. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, up to 24 hours (longer = more flavor)

### Quick Pickle the Onions

1. Place sliced red onion in a small bowl with vinegar or lemon juice. Let sit while preparing the rest of the dish

### Make the Biryani Rice

1. Rinse brown basmati rice until water runs clear. Soak in water for 20 minutes, then drain
1. In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat ghee/butter over medium heat
1. Add sliced onion and cook until golden brown, 8-10 minutes. Remove half of the onions and set aside for garnish
1. To the remaining onions in the pot, add garlic, ginger, cardamom, bay leaves, cinnamon, cloves, and cumin seeds. Cook until fragrant, ~1 minute
1. Add drained rice and stir to coat with the aromatics, ~2 minutes
1. Add water/broth and salt. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 40-45 minutes until rice is tender
1. Remove from heat and let sit covered for 10 minutes. Fluff with a fork and remove whole spices if desired

### Cook the Chicken Tikka

1. Preheat oven to 425F (or heat air fryer to 400F)
1. Thread chicken pieces onto skewers if using, or arrange on a foil-lined baking sheet
1. Bake for 20-25 minutes, flipping halfway, until cooked through (internal temp 165F) and slightly charred at edges. Or air fry for 12-15 minutes, shaking halfway
1. Alternative: Cook in a hot skillet with 1 Tbsp oil over medium-high heat, 4-5 minutes per side

### Make the Raita

1. In a bowl, combine yogurt, grated cucumber, mint, cumin, and salt. Mix well and refrigerate until serving

### Assemble Bowls

1. Divide biryani rice among serving bowls
1. Top with chicken tikka pieces
1. Add dollops of raita, pickled red onions, reserved crispy onions, and fresh cilantro
1. Garnish with toasted nuts, hard-boiled eggs (if using), and lemon wedges

## Notes

- **Traditional preparation:** Uses white basmati rice, which cooks in 15-20 minutes and has a lighter, fluffier texture
- **Flavor/texture tradeoff with brown rice:** Brown basmati has a chewier texture and nuttier flavor. The whole spices help add aromatic flavor to compensate. If you prefer traditional texture, use white basmati or a 50/50 white/brown blend
- **Protein alternatives:** Substitute chicken with 1.5 lbs paneer cubes, extra-firm tofu, ground turkey keema (cook with spices before adding to bowl), or a mix of chickpeas and vegetables
- **Spice level:** Adjust cayenne pepper to taste. Kashmiri chili powder gives color without much heat
- **Make ahead:** Marinate chicken up to 24 hours. Cook rice and chicken separately and store in fridge for 3-4 days. Raita lasts 2-3 days
- **Meal prep tip:** Rice reheats best with a sprinkle of water in the microwave, covered
