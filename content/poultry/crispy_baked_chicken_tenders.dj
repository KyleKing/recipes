## Ingredients

- [ ] 1 pound chicken tenders
- [ ] ⅓ cup all-purpose flour (or gluten-free flour)
- [ ] 2 large eggs
- [ ] 6 cups white or yellow corn tortilla chips (or substitute 1 cup panko breadcrumbs)
- [ ] ¼ teaspoon salt (only if using panko instead of chips)

### For Serving

- [ ] Ketchup
- [ ] Ranch dressing
- [ ] Marinara sauce
- [ ] Applesauce
- [ ] Honey mustard

## Recipe

1. Preheat oven to 425°F
1. Place a wire rack in a rimmed baking sheet and coat with nonstick cooking spray
1. If using tortilla chips, pulse in food processor into fine crumbs (should yield about 1 cup). Pour into a shallow dish
1. Place flour in a second shallow dish
1. Beat eggs lightly in a third shallow dish
1. Working with one chicken tender at a time, coat completely in flour, shaking off excess
1. Dip floured tender in beaten egg, letting excess drip off
1. Press into tortilla chip crumbs (or panko), coating all sides thoroughly
1. Arrange breaded tenders on the prepared wire rack without touching
1. Bake for 14-15 minutes until golden and fully cooked through (internal temperature 165°F)
1. Serve warm or at room temperature with your choice of dipping sauces

## Notes

- Using a wire rack is essential for achieving crispy results on all sides. Without it, the bottoms will be soggy
- Tortilla chips create a unique crunchy texture and add flavor. For panko version, add ¼ teaspoon salt to the flour before breading
- These are naturally kid-friendly and can be served with a variety of dipping sauces to suit different preferences
- Store leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days
- Reheat in a 350°F oven for 5-7 minutes to restore crispiness (avoid microwave which makes them soggy)
- Great for meal prep - bread all tenders, freeze unbaked on a baking sheet, then transfer to freezer bag. Bake from frozen, adding 3-5 minutes to cooking time
- Pairs well with sweet potato fries, roasted vegetables, or a simple side salad
