## Ingredients

### Marinade

- [ ] 3 Tbsp lime juice
- [ ] 3 Tbsp pineapple juice (no sugar added)
- [ ] 2 Tbsp Worcestershire sauce
- [ ] 2 Tbsp avocado or olive oil
- [ ] 5 cloves garlic, pressed or minced
- [ ] 2 tsp ground cumin
- [ ] 2 tsp chili powder
- [ ] 1 tsp smoked paprika
- [ ] 1 tsp Mexican oregano
- [ ] 1/2 tsp onion powder
- [ ] 2 Tbsp chopped cilantro
- [ ] 1 1/2 tsp salt
- [ ] 1/2 tsp black pepper
- [ ] 1 jalapeño, sliced (optional)

### Main

- [ ] 2 lbs boneless skinless chicken breasts or thighs
- [ ] 3 bell peppers (any color), thinly sliced
- [ ] 1 red or yellow onion, thinly sliced
- [ ] 2 tsp vegetable oil for cooking

### With

- [ ] 10-12 flour tortillas
- [ ] guacamole or sliced avocado
- [ ] pico de gallo or salsa
- [ ] sour cream
- [ ] shredded cheese
- [ ] lime wedges
- [ ] cilantro

## Recipe

1. Whisk together all marinade ingredients. Add chicken, cover, and refrigerate 4-6 hours (or minimum 1 hour). Remove from fridge 30 minutes before cooking
1. Heat cast iron skillet or heavy skillet over high heat. Add 1 tsp oil, then cook half the chicken 3-5 minutes per side until internal temperature reaches 160°F. Rest several minutes, then slice thinly. Repeat with remaining chicken
1. Add 1 tsp oil to skillet over high heat. Cook half the peppers and onions until sizzling and slightly charred, 5-7 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Repeat with remaining vegetables
1. Heat tortillas by cooking each 15 seconds per side over a burner or in a dry skillet until puffed
1. Serve sliced chicken and vegetables with warm tortillas and toppings so diners can assemble their own

## Notes

- Pineapple juice acts as a natural tenderizer—don't marinate longer than 6 hours or chicken becomes tough
- For more heat, substitute 4 dried chiles de arbol in the marinade or add sliced jalapeños when cooking vegetables
- Cast iron skillet gives the best char and sizzle

### Instant Pot Variation (No Marinating)

For a quick weeknight version, skip the marinade and use an Instant Pot:

1. Slice chicken thinly and cut peppers slightly thicker. Add to Instant Pot with onions
1. Toss with dry seasonings only: 3 Tbsp fajita seasoning blend (cumin, chili powder, smoked paprika, oregano, onion powder, salt, pepper) and 1 Tbsp oil
1. Add 1/4 cup water. Seal lid, set valve to sealing
1. Pressure cook on high for 4 minutes, then quick release
1. Optional: transfer chicken and vegetables to hot skillet for 2-3 minutes to add char
1. Serve immediately with warm tortillas and toppings

Note: Pressure cooking infuses flavor without marinating. Save the cooking liquid to make fajita-flavored rice.
