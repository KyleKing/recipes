## Ingredients

- [ ] 4 tablespoons water
- [ ] 2 1/2 teaspoons unflavored gelatin (1 packet)
- [ ] 2 cups plain whole-milk Greek yogurt
- [ ] 2 cups milk, heavy cream, or combination
- [ ] 1/4 to 1/2 cup granulated sugar
- [ ] 2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice
- [ ] 1/3 to 1/2 cup honey for serving
- [ ] 1/2 to 3/4 cup toasted, chopped walnuts for serving

## Recipe

1. Lightly oil a 9-inch cake pan or individual ramekins if unmolding later.
2. Mix water and gelatin in a small bowl. Let soften for 15 minutes.
3. In a large bowl, whisk together yogurt and 1 cup of the milk/cream mixture.
4. Heat remaining milk/cream and sugar in a saucepan until simmering.
5. Stir gelatin mixture into hot liquid until dissolved. Remove from heat.
6. Whisk hot mixture into yogurt mixture, then stir in lemon juice at the end.
7. Pour into prepared pan or cups.
8. Chill at least 2 hours for individual servings, up to 8 hours for large pan. Best made the night before.
9. To unmold large pan: dip bottom in 1-inch boiling water for 10 seconds, then invert onto a flat platter. For individual cups: dip bottoms in simmering water for 5 seconds, then invert onto plates.
10. Top with walnuts and honey immediately before serving.

## Notes

1. Using full-fat Greek yogurt is essential for optimal richness and texture
2. Honey becomes liquid if added too early, so top immediately before serving
3. Adjust sugar level (1/4 to 1/2 cup) based on sweetness preference
4. Can use all milk, all cream, or a combination depending on desired richness
