## Ingredients

### Dry Ingredients

- [ ] 1 1/4 cups (150g) white whole wheat flour or gluten-free flour
- [ ] 1 cup (80g) unsweetened cocoa powder
- [ ] 2 teaspoons baking soda
- [ ] 1 teaspoon baking powder
- [ ] 1/2 teaspoon salt

### Wet Ingredients

- [ ] 1 teaspoon coconut oil or unsalted butter, melted
- [ ] 2 large egg whites, room temperature
- [ ] 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- [ ] 2 teaspoons pure maple syrup
- [ ] 1/2 cup (120g) plain nonfat Greek yogurt
- [ ] 1/4 cup (60mL) distilled white vinegar
- [ ] 3/4 cup (180mL) nonfat milk
- [ ] 5 tablespoons (75mL) water

### For Serving

- [ ] Fresh fruit (berries, banana slices, strawberries)
- [ ] Additional maple syrup
- [ ] Greek yogurt or coconut whipped cream

## Recipe

1. Preheat oven to 350°F and coat two waffle pans generously with nonstick cooking spray.
2. In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder, and salt.
3. In another bowl, whisk coconut oil, egg whites, vanilla, and maple syrup together. Add Greek yogurt, stirring until lumps disappear. Stir in vinegar and milk.
4. Alternate adding flour mixture and water to wet ingredients, beginning and ending with flour mixture. Stir until just incorporated (add flour in three equal parts for best results).
5. Divide batter between prepared pans, spreading with a spatula. Bake at 350°F for 10-13 minutes until centers feel firm and a toothpick comes out clean.
6. Allow waffles to cool in pan for 10 minutes before transferring to a wire rack.
7. For crispy outsides, toast cooled waffles in a toaster oven until golden brown.
8. Serve warm with fresh fruit, maple syrup, and Greek yogurt or coconut whipped cream.

## Notes

1. Makes 12 waffles at approximately 78 calories per waffle
2. Suggested serving size: 2-3 waffles with fruit and maple syrup
3. Greek yogurt adds moisture and protein instead of extra butter or oil
4. Naturally sweetened with pure maple syrup instead of refined sugar
5. Can be frozen and reheated for quick breakfasts or desserts
