## Ingredients

- [ ] 3/4 cup sweet potato puree
- [ ] 1 cup peanut or almond butter (or allergy-friendly substitute)
- [ ] 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
- [ ] 6 tablespoons flour (oat, white, spelt, or almond flour)
- [ ] 1/2 cup mini chocolate chips (plus more for topping, optional)
- [ ] 2/3 cup sugar
- [ ] 6 tablespoons cocoa powder
- [ ] 1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
- [ ] 1/8 teaspoon salt

## Recipe

1. Preheat oven to 325°F. Line an 8-inch baking pan with parchment paper or grease well.
2. If needed, gently warm the nut butter to soften. Whisk together the nut butter, sweet potato puree, and vanilla until smooth.
3. In a separate bowl, combine flour, chocolate chips, sugar, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt, ensuring the baking soda and salt are evenly distributed.
4. Pour dry ingredients into wet ingredients and stir until a batter forms.
5. Smooth the batter into the prepared pan, ensuring all traces are transferred.
6. Use parchment paper to smooth everything down evenly.
7. Bake for 20 minutes on the center rack. The brownies will appear underdone when removed but firm up as they cool.
8. If too gooey after cooling, refrigerate loosely for several hours.

## Notes

1. Makes 12-16 brownies
2. Suggested serving size: 1 brownie
3. Rich, decadent, and unbelievably fudgy
4. Sweet potato adds depth of flavor and moisture without needing oil
5. Optional: frost with sweet potato chocolate frosting (blend melted chocolate chips with baked sweet potato flesh)
6. Store in refrigerator for best texture
