Egg Advice:

- Choose eggs that are 10+ days old, which will be easier to peel
- Allow to cool before peeling
- Tap gently on counter top until evenly cracked, roll the egg between hands to loosen the shell, then peel under cool water
- If left int he original shell, eggs can be stored for up to one week
