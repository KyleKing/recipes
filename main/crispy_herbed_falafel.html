Pulse until the chickpeas are just reduced to smaller chunks. Shove the mixture around with a spatula<li>Add the salt, cumin and pepper. Process until the mixture is finely chopped but not pureed, stopping to scrape down the sides.<li>The mixture should resemble coarse meal, not a smooth hummus. It should mostly hold together when you press a clump in your hands<li>Add the cilantro and parsley to the food processor. Pulse until the herbs are finely chopped and evenly distributed<li>Test the mixture again by trying to shape it into a mound. Continue to process until it keeps its shape.</ol><li>Use a 1.5-inch ice cream scoop or your hands to form a total of 30-40 slightly mounded disks that are about 1.5 inches wide. (If using a scoop, gently flatten them a bit with your hands&ndash;helps to promote even cooking better than a ball)<li>Baking<ol><li>To bake the falafel, place them on a rimmed baking sheet generously slicked with olive oil.

Repeat to cook all the falafel, making sure the oil returns to the proper temperature before adding the next batch.</ol></ol></ol></section><section id=Notes><h2>Notes</h2><p>These turned out OK. They mostly held together and I had the leftovers in a couple of meals including the meal in the photo<ol><li>Tip: get the mixture right. You really do want to break it down enough so the mixture holds together. As long as you don&rsquo;t take it to a puree, you&rsquo;re fine. Check it along the way, squeezing it together with your fingers. The addition of the herbs to the chickpea mixture will add a little moisture to make it more cohesive<li>Tip: Also, make sure you&rsquo;re giving yourself enough room to process the dried chickpeas. Our 8-cup food processor in the Food Lab was not big enough to hold everything and efficiently mix it. Dividing it into two batches helped, but even then I used a spatula every so often to push the mixture around and confirm it was all coming in contact with the blade.<li>For a spicy red falafel, skip the herbs and add between 1/4-1/2 cup of harissa. Stirring into the processed chickpeas by hand<li>If using canned chickpeas, consider mixing in bread crumbs, panko, or flour to thicken, like <a href=https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/25309/seans-falafel-and-cucumber-sauce/>in this recipe</a><li>FYI, the chickpeas could be cooked in <a href=https://www.pressurecookrecipes.com/instant-pot-chickpeas/>the Instant Pot instead of soaking</a>, but soaking is easier</ol></section></main>
