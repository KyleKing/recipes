{"ingredients":["2 (14-ounce) blocks extrafirm tofu, sliced lengthwise 1-inch-thick","2 tablespoons brown sugar (light or dark)","2 tablespoons white miso paste","2 tablespoons soy sauce","2 tablespoons rice vinegar","1 tablespoon vegetable oil","¼ to ½ teaspoon ground cayenne"],"steps":["Arrange tofu slices on a clean kitchen towel or paper towels. Cover with another kitchen towel (or paper towels), and place a flat cutting board or sheet pan on top. Stack a few cans or a skillet on top to weigh it down. Let tofu drain for 15 to 45 minutes.","Meanwhile, in a large bowl, stir together the sugar, miso, soy sauce, rice vinegar, oil and cayenne until smooth. Tear the tofu into bite-size pieces (about 1 inch), and add to the miso mixture. Stir gently to coat. You can cook the tofu right away, or cover and refrigerate to marinate for up to 24 hours.","When you \u0026rsquo; re ready to cook, arrange a rack about 6 inches from the broiler and heat broiler to high. Line a sheet pan with aluminum foil. Remove the tofu from the marinade and arrange on the sheet pan. Reserve marinade.","Broil, flipping occasionally through with a spatula, until browned and crisp, 10 to 15 minutes total. (Broilers have hot spots, so check the tofu periodically and rotate the pan and tofu as needed so everything crisps.) Drizzle with the reserved marinade."],"title":"Miso Broiled Tofu"}
