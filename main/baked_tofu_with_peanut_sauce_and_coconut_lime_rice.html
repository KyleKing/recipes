Add the sliced peppers, a few cracks of black pepper and set aside.<li>In a small pot, combine the rice with 1 cup water and the coconut milk. Season with salt and bring to a simmer. Cover and cook over medium-low until the rice is just tender, 12 to 15 minutes. Remove from the heat and let sit, covered, until ready to serve.<li>In a medium bowl, whisk 4 Tbsp lime juice with the peanut butter, miso, ginger, fish sauce (if using), habanero, 2 Tbsp oil, 1 Tbsp honey and Â¾ cup water. Stir until smooth and season to taste with salt.<li>Arrange the tofu pieces in a single layer on the oiled baking sheet and season with salt. Spoon about 2 Tbsp of the peanut sauce over each, covering the top and allowing the sauce to run down and coat the sides. Drizzle the tops with some oil, and roast until glaze is set, deep brown and caramelized along the edges, 18 to 20 minutes. Add the remaining lime juice and 1 Tbsp honey to the leftover peanut sauce in the bowl to make the dressing; set aside.<li>Divide the greens among bowls. Add the lime zest and half the sliced scallions to the rice, then fluff with a fork. Top the greens with the rice, then the tofu. Spoon the peanut dressing over everything, and garnish with the drained pickled peppers and remaining sliced scallions</ol></section></main>
