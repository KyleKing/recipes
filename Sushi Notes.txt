When the sushi rice is wrapped in nori (seaweed) and rolled, it is a Sushi Roll.  In Japan we call it Makizushi or Maki Sushi (巻き寿司). There are several types of sushi rolls:

Hosomaki (細巻き) – Thin rolls (1″ in diameter), nori on outside, containing 1 ingredient
Chumaki (中巻き) – Medium rolls (1-1.5″ in dameter), nori on outside, containing 2-3 ingredients
Futomaki (太巻き) – Thick rolls (2-2.5″ in diameter), nori on outside, containing 4-5 ingredients
Uramaki (裏巻き) – “Inside-out” rolls (nori on the inside – like California Roll)
Temaki (手巻き) – Cone-shaped hand rolls – Click for Recipe
