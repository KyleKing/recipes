Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl as needed.</ol><li>In a separate bowl, whisk the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt together until combined. With the mixer running on low speed, slowly pour into the wet ingredients<ol><li>Beat on low until combined and then beat in the chocolate chips<li>Cover dough tightly and chill in the refrigerator for <strong>at least 3 hours and up to 3 days</strong>. Chilling is mandatory for this sticky cookie dough.</ol></ol></section><section id=Bake><h3>Bake</h3><ol><li>Remove cookie dough from the refrigerator and allow to sit at room temperature for 10 minutes (or 20 min if chilled for longer than 3 hours) until easier to scoop and roll.<li>Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Line large baking sheets with silicone baking mats and set aside<li>Scoop and roll dough into balls, about 1.5 Tbsps of dough each. A medium cookie scoop is helpful here<ol><li>Roll each ball very lightly in granulated sugar, then generously in the confectioners’ sugar. Place 3 inches apart on the baking sheets</ol><li>Bake the cookies for 11-12 minutes or until the edges appear set and the centers still look soft<ol><li>Tip: if they aren’t really spreading by minute 9, remove the pan from the oven and lightly tap on the counter 2-3x to loosen them. Return to the oven to continue baking</ol><li>Cool cookies for 5 minutes on the baking sheet, and then transfer to a cooling rack to cool completely. The cookies will slightly deflate as they cool.</ol></section><section id=Notes><h2>Notes</h2><ol><li>Can I add peppermint extract? Yes, absolutely! If you want a chocolate peppermint crinkle cookie, I recommend adding 3/4 or 1 tsp of peppermint extract when you add the vanilla.<li>Larger Batch: The recipe is easy to double in 1 mixing bowl without overwhelming your mixer. Simply double all of the ingredients. Dough chill time remains the same.</ol></section></main>
