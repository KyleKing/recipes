{"ingredients":["1 (11.5 ounce) jar dulce de leche","½ cup unsweetened shredded coconut"],"steps":["Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper.","Whisk cornstarch, flour, baking powder, and baking soda together; set aside.","Beat butter and sugar together in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Beat in 2 egg yolks, one at a time, beating well after each addition; beat in third yolk along with lemon zest, vanilla rum, vanilla extract, and lemon extract. Gently fold in cornstarch mixture with a spoon, making a crumbly dough, until cohesive enough; press into a ball. Wrap dough in plastic wrap; chill 30 to 60 minutes.","Roll dough out, using as little flour as possible, until about ¼-inch thick. (The dough will have an unusual consistency.) Cut dough using a small round cookie cutter. Continue pressing dough together, rolling, and cutting until all dough is used. Place cookies spaced ½-inch apart onto the prepared cookie sheets.","Bake in the preheated oven until set but not browned, 7 to 10 minutes. Transfer cookies immediately to a wire rack to cool.","Spread 1 teaspoon dulce de leche onto underside of 1 cooled cookie; sandwich with second cookie until caramel oozes out sides. Roll sides in shredded coconut. Repeat with remaining cookies, dulce de leche, and coconut."],"title":"Alfajores Argentinean Style"}
